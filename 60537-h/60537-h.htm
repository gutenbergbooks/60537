  <h2 class='c005'>PREFACE</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>It is a necessity of the human mind to give
everything a name, thus recognising a difference
between one thing and another, and
recording it. Science, which is the highest
development of this necessity, recognises, and
records systematically, all the facts of experience,
distinguishing one from another, by the
most minute analysis. The Maoris even go
so far as bestow on their greenstone clubs, on
their <i><span lang="mi" xml:lang="mi">tikis</span></i>, and on almost every separate
article, a distinct name, as if recognising an
individuality, much as the old myth-makers
spoke of the sword Excalibur; but the average
man is usually very loose in his application of
terms. Renan in his preface to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"Dialogues
Philosophiques"</span> writes: <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"La grande majorité
des hommes ... se divise en deux catégories,
à égale distance desquelles il nous semble qu'
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vi'>vi</span>est la vérité. 'Ce que vous cherchez est
trouvé depuis longtemps,' disent les orthodoxes
de toutes les nuances. 'Ce que vous
cherchez n'est pas trouvable,' disent les positivistes
pratiques (les seuls dangereux), les
politiques railleurs, les athées."</span> Having thus
differentiated his own position, from that of
either school, one is a little surprised to find
Matthew Arnold saying of him, that "the
greatest intellect in France has declared for
materialism." One recognises how pernicious
the loose application of terms may be, and is
a little irritated to discover a fine English
critic lapsing into the vice, even in an unguarded
moment. Really, thought, or at
least any thought that justifies its existence,
is too subtile and fluid a thing to be settled
in this off-hand way; and the apparently
childish custom of the Maoris is more scientific,
since, at least, it recognises individuality.</p>

<p class='c000'>Turn away from Renan to Euripides, and
consider for a moment the present conflict
as to whether "The Bacchae" is a recantation
by Euripides of his supposed rationalistic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_vii'>vii</span>opinions, or a more aggravated expression of
them. It seems impossible that there should
be two suppositions, so far removed from
each other, about an existing book, in a
known language, by an author whose style
is singularly lucid. <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"La chicane s'allonge,"</span> as
Montaigne said. We must seek for the
truth at an equal distance from both parties.
Those who sustain either of the extreme
theories are equally clear and convincing in
their arguments. As each party seems to
have a personal interest in the matter, we
may be certain that it will find what it is
looking for, without much trouble; but they
both seem to be striving more often after a
reputation for themselves than after the real
thought of their author. One ingenious critic
even goes so far as to assert that Dionysos
does not work miracles, but merely hypnotises
the chorus into a belief that he has done so,
to the great amusement of the audience.
Perhaps it is some mental disability which
prevents me from enjoying "The Bacchae"
as a comedy, but I own I cannot. To
<span class='pageno' id='Page_viii'>viii</span>Renan and to Euripides one might apply the
term <span lang="el" xml:lang="el">ἀνὴρ δίψυχος</span>. They were both equally
saturated with the scientific spirit of their age,
though inclining to the mystic temperament.
They were both quickened by a deep love
and pity for humanity in all its moods and
aspirations. They both delighted keenly in
popular legends and the mythology of the
country-side. Both were strongly individual
minds, sensitive, reacting to every contemporary
influence, and yet preserving their
peculiar distinction in thought and style.
Unbound by any system, moving easily in
all, they sought by the free exercise of reason
and a profound irony to cleanse their ages of
much perilous stuff; and though Renan was
not a Christian in the common sense of the
word, and though Euripides turned away from
the gods of his own day, yet each tried to
save out of the ruins of their faiths the subtile
and elusive spirit which had informed them;
that divine light and inspiration, which is
continually expressing itself in new figures,
and cannot be imprisoned in any vessel of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_ix'>ix</span>human fashioning. "Anima naturaliter Christiana,"
we can say of each. There are in
reality only two religions on this little planet,
and they perhaps begin and end with man.
They are: the religion of the humble folk,
whose life is a daily communion with natural
forces, and a bending to them; and the
religion of men like Protagoras, Lucretius,
and Montaigne, a religion of doubt, of tolerance,
of agnosticism. Between these two
poles is nothing but a dreary waste of formalism,
Pharisaism, "perplexed subtleties about
Instants, Formalities, Quiddities, and Relations,"
all that bewildering of brains which
comes from being shut up in a narrow system,
like an invalid in a poisoned and stifling
room.</p>

<p class='c000'>I think that all the world's greatest men
have had this quality of double-mindedness.
Take, for example, the curious paradox of
Epicureanism, which counsels a temperate
pleasure, and yet condemns the whole of life
as being merely the pursuit of an unattainable
desire; reconciling us to life by the prospect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_x'>x</span>of death, and to death by showing us the
vain efforts and innumerable vexations of life.
The same double-mindedness partly explains
for us the difference between the Socrates of
Plato and the Socrates of Xenophon; though
we must not overlook the fundamental difference
in the biographers. This elusive and
various quality of greatness has not, I think,
been sufficiently recognised. There is no more
suggestive expression of it than the character
of Christ as sketched by Oscar Wilde in "De
Profundis," which may be supplemented by
the masterly delineation of M. Loisy in his
prolegomena to <span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">"Les Evangiles Synoptiques."</span></p>

<p class='c000'>In the following studies, the principal influence
is that of Renan; though I profess I
cannot gauge its full extent. The discourse
of Protagoras owes some of its principles to
the dialogue "Certitudes"; but the pivot,
upon which the whole question turns, came
directly from a study of the "Theaetetus" and
the "Protagoras," so that the debt is scarcely
perceptible. Protagoras himself practically
does not exist for us, we can only evoke a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xi'>xi</span>shadowy image of him from Plato, for whose
somewhat reactionary bias full allowance must
be made. The result is a vague reflection
with blurred outlines, but gracious, and with
neither the greed nor the vanity of the other
sophists. I do not think that Renan's verdicts
have influenced my treatment of St Paul.
Renan has a natural prejudice against <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">ce
laid petit Juif</span></i>, with his Rabbinical pseudo-science,
and his blindness to the beauty of
the Greek spirit, his scorn of the "idols," and
his misconception of what was meant by "the
unknown God." I do not share this prejudice.
I am perfectly willing to take a thing
for what it is, and not to grumble at it for
not being other than it is. The strength of
St Paul was like the strength of one of
Michelangelo's unfinished statues; the idea is
emerging from the marble, but it is still
veiled, rude, scarred by the chisel, and not
yet quite free of its material.</p>

<p class='c000'>Machiavelli said that to renew anything
we must return to its origins. It is as true
in literature as in life. My aim has been to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_xii'>xii</span>derive everything from the original source;
but it is difficult to avoid being touched by
contemporary influences. The majority of
these, in my case, have been French. I am
indebted for the two characteristic letters of
Innocent III. to Achille Luchaire's admirable
history of that Pope, which he fortunately
lived to finish; and to the always fascinating
Gaston Boissier for his various work on Rome.
I am under a deep obligation to Mr L. Arthur
Burd, as are all English students of Machiavelli.
Finally, I am indebted, more than I
can say, to M. l'Abbé Houtin for his interest
and encouragement, and to Mr Arthur Galton
for his example and conversation.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>I<br /> <br />THE KING OF URUK</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>When Merodach, the King of Uruk, sate
down to his meals, he made his enemies his
foot-stool; for beneath his table he kept an
hundred kings, with their thumbs and great
toes cut off, as living witnesses of his power
and clemency. When the crumbs fell from
the table of Merodach, the Kings would feed
themselves with two fingers; and when
Merodach observed how painful and difficult
the operation was, he praised God for having
given thumbs to man.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is by the absence of thumbs," he said,
"that we are enabled to discern their use.
We invariably learn the importance of what
we lack. If we remove the eyes from a man
we deprive him of sight; and consequently
we learn that sight is the function of the eyes."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_2'>2</span>Thus spake Merodach, for he had a scientific
mind, and was curious of God's handiwork;
and when he had finished speaking the
courtiers applauded him.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Great is the power of the Great King, and
most wonderful is his wisdom," cried the
courtiers; and the King shook out his napkin
under the table, shaking the crumbs among
his prostrate enemies, for the applause was
pleasant to him; but from beneath the table
came a harsh, sarcastic voice.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Great is the power of the Great King, and
most wonderful is his wisdom," said the voice;
"but neither from his power nor from his
wisdom can he fashion us new thumbs."</p>

<p class='c000'>Then was Merodach angry, and he bade his
courtiers seize the speaker and draw him from
beneath the table; and the man they drew
out was Shalmaneser, who had been a king
among the kings of Chaldæa. And at first
Merodach was of a mind to kill Shalmaneser;
but, seeing that his captive sought for death,
his heart relented, and he bade his courtiers
restore him to his place beneath the table.</p>

<p class='c000'>"My power and my wisdom are great," he
said; "since I have so afflicted mine enemies
that they fear not to tell me the truth."</p>

<p class='c000'>And when Merodach had eaten, he rose
<span class='pageno' id='Page_3'>3</span>from the table and went out into the gardens
of the terrace where the nightingales were
singing; but the kings beneath the table
smote Shalmaneser sorely upon both cheeks,
and upon his buttocks, and tore out the hair
of his beard; for after that he had spoken,
Merodach had shaken out the crumbs from
his napkin among them no more, and they
had supped poorly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then Merodach wandered about in his
garden, listening to the song of the nightingales
who nested there, and smelling the
sweet smells of the flowers that were odorous
in the cool of the evening; and behind him,
fifty paces, there followed his guards, for he
was afraid for his life. The dew fell upon
the glazed bricks, gleaming in the moonlight,
and hung from the trees and flowers like
little trembling stars. Merodach leaned his
arms upon a balustrade and looked over the
city which he had builded on the left bank of
the Euphrates, and watched the illuminated
barges that went up and down the river,
rowing with music upon the waters; and he
looked toward the high temples looming into
the night, and he thought of his glory and
was exceeding sad.</p>

<p class='c000'>"In a little time I die," he said; "but the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_4'>4</span>city which I have builded will be a witness
for me while man survives on the earth."</p>

<p class='c000'>And from the barges came the pleasant
sound of music, floating through the night,
and Merodach regretted that he would have
to die, and in a little while would walk no
more through his garden in the cool of the
evening, listening to the sounds of life, and
smelling the sweet breath of the flowers.</p>

<p class='c000'>"In a little while the race of man will have
perished from off the earth," he said; "and
there will be no memory of me, but the stars
will shine still above my ruined and tenantless
palace."</p>

<p class='c000'>And the night-wind, laden with scents and
sounds, shook the dew from the trembling
leaves, and moved his silken raiment; and
Merodach was overcome with a passion for
life.</p>

<p class='c000'>"In a little time," he thought, "even the
stars will have vanished."</p>

<p class='c000'>And from the adjoining gardens of his
harem he heard the voices of women waiting
to pleasure their lord; and he went in unto
them for he feared to be alone.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c000'>In the garden of Merodach's harem, the
Queen Parysatis held a feast in honour of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_5'>5</span>her daughter, the Princess Candace, who was
eleven years old. The Queen Parysatis lay
upon a pile of cushions looking at a tragedy
that was being enacted by a company of
eunuchs. The Princess Candace was standing
beside a deep basin of silver, seventy cubits
in diameter, called the Sea of Silver; and
she threw sugar-plums to a troop of little
girls, who dived after them, gleaming fish-like
in the luminous depths. When she saw
the King, her father, she stopped throwing
sugar-plums, and the little girls came out of
the water, and sate upon the silver rim, their
wet, naked limbs glimmering in the moonlight.
Then the Princess Candace did homage
before Merodach, bowing down before him
and touching his feet; and he stretched forth
his hand to her, and led her to a couch,
because he loved his children, and she was
as beautiful as the new moon before it is a
day old.</p>

<p class='c000'>Now it chanced that at that time the High-priest
Bagoas, who was High-priest of the
temple of Bel at Nippur, was in the palace
of the King; and Merodach sent for him,
desiring him to speak comfortable doctrine
and words cheering to the heart; and Bagoas
came in unto Merodach, and did homage
<span class='pageno' id='Page_6'>6</span>before him, bowing down before him and
touching his feet; and there was no one in
the cities of Babylonia more powerful than
Bagoas, unless it were the King himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>"As I walked in the garden in the evening,"
said Merodach, "I became afflicted with a
sense of human transience and of the vanity
of greatness. In a little time, I said, I shall
be but a handful of dust. Then I comforted
myself with the thought that I should live
in the memory of man, through my monuments,
while man survives upon the earth;
but in a little time man himself disappears,
I said, and even the stars are lost in darkness."</p>

<p class='c000'>And Bagoas smiled.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is true, O King, man cometh upon
the earth and rules it for a little space, like a
god. In hollow ships, he sails over the pathless
sea; and he has mapped out the heavens
naming the stars; and he follows the courses
of the planets round the sun; and he knoweth
the seasons of reaping and sowing, by the constellations
rising or setting in the sky. His
cunning mind has devised screws to draw
water up out of the earth, and pulleys and
levers to uplift masses beyond his strength.
He is a master of populous cities, a weaver
of delicate textures, a limner of images in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_7'>7</span>fair colours; he is a tamer of horses, skilled
in the knowledge of flocks and herds; with
hooks he draweth fish out of the sea, and with
an arrow transfixes a bird on the wing; he
fashions the metals in fire, beating the gold
and stubborn bronze to his will. He understands
the laws of Nature, and has named
the force which draws the earth round the
sun, and the moon round the earth; but
time is his master, and he cannot find a
remedy against death."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Nor fashion a thumb for man," said
Merodach.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The fear of death is the greatest incitement
to live," continued Bagoas. "It is the
goad which incessantly urges us to action.
Our desire to live, to persist in one form or
another, impels us to beget children, to overpower
the imagination of future ages by the
splendour of our monuments and the record
of our lives. We seek to stamp our image
upon our time, and influence our generation
by every means in our power. But even
this is not enough, so we have built ourselves
a little world beyond the grave, a little haven
beyond the waves of time. We believe that
our souls will exist when our bodies have
fallen into decay and escaped into a thousand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_8'>8</span>different forms of new life, to be woven eternally
on the loom of perpetual change. We believe
that death is merely a transition, and that
through virtue man is able to scale the
brazen ramparts of the city of the gods."</p>

<p class='c000'>"If he is very good," said the Princess
Candace.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Little Princess," said Bagoas, smiling,
"your beauty is like a bright rainbow in the
sky; the sunlight streaming upon drifting rain.
Have you ever considered the personality of
man, O King? Everything that has existed
in the past exists in the soul of man. In
its depths are the primeval monsters, Apsu
and Tiamat. In its heights are enthroned
the gods; action in it is heaped upon action
to become habit, and habit upon habit to
become character; all that we have seen, all
that we have touched, the experience of the
senses, the illusions of the brain, the desires
of the heart, our ancestors, our companions,
our country and occupations, all move and
work mysteriously in our being. Each has
left its trace upon the personality of man.
Do you seek immortality for these? You
will leave them with the world. Seek for
yourself before you seek for self's immortality.
Beneath what you seem to be lies what you
<span class='pageno' id='Page_9'>9</span>think you are, and beneath that again lies
what you are indeed."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Alas," cried Queen Parysatis, "such an
immortality is too unsubstantial. It is our
illusions, our experiences, and our aspirations,
which give a savour to existence. What is
the use of immortality if we leave everything
we love?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Mankind, O King," answered Bagoas,
"loves its imperfections more than its perfections,
and values as nothing an immortality
which is devoid of our human
frailties, our pitiful human friendships, our
personal predilections which we obtusely term
our principles."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is true," said Merodach, "I die; but
that which is mortal of me remains upon
earth to be a witness for me in the memory
of man."</p>

<p class='c000'>"The whole of recorded time is but a second,
a pulsation, in the ages," answered Bagoas,
"and the memory of man is the frailest of
monuments. The Temple of Bel at Nippur is
not two thousand years old; yet its bricks are
engraven with a dead language, and we know
not its builder's name. So it will be with thy
temples and cities, O King!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have said it," answered Merodach.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_10'>10</span>"Perhaps after thousands of years have
lapsed," continued Bagoas, "a peasant will find
a brick with thy name upon it, and cast it
aside, or tread it under foot. But even to-day
I have met and spoken with a man in whose
horoscope it was written that his name would
be remembered while man exists upon the
earth; yet he is naked, and his house is a
cabin of boughs."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Was it foreshadowed that he would become
King?" enquired Merodach anxiously.</p>

<p class='c000'>"No; his inheritance is poverty and pain."</p>

<p class='c000'>"What is his name?" enquired the King.</p>

<p class='c000'>"His name is Adam," answered Bagoas.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then there was a silence in the garden of
the King's harem; and Merodach wondered
that the memory of one who went naked, and
dwelt in a cabin of boughs, should outlast the
memory of a King before whom the nations
trembled, who went clothed in purple and fine
linen, and whose palace was built of thirty-five
million bricks. But he consoled himself
with the thought that eventually even Adam
would be forgotten, and the lights of Sirius
and Aldebaran extinguished.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Tell me of Adam," he said to Bagoas; and
the Princess Candace drew closer to listen.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_11'>11</span>"Our life, O King, is a series of accidents,"
said Bagoas. "A little thing is sufficient to
divert the whole course of our progress; it
has even been said by our philosophers that
the world itself is an accident, and that God
is chance. I am inclined to believe, being
old-fashioned, in Providence; for chance is
merely a cause that is imperceptible, and if
the deflection of atoms falling through space
caused the world, that deflection was the result
of some feature peculiar to the atoms themselves.
I believe that, if the world were
formed in this way, the cause was inherent in
the atoms, and I believe that the progress of
each man through life is derived from causes
inherent in himself. But the operations of
the human mind are so far removed from our
experience, and so elusive in themselves, that
we cannot explain them otherwise than by
saying that Bel, by the hands of his angels,
puts into man's mind ideas of good or of
evil according to the purpose of his inscrutable
wisdom. The greater part of man's life
is purely spontaneous, sensible rather than
reasonable in so far as the majority of our
actions do not result from any reflective
process, and hence it is unreasonable to ask
a man to give reasons for all his acts, as it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_12'>12</span>would be to ask you, O King, to give a
reason for your last campaign."</p>

<p class='c000'>"That was a reason of State," said Merodach
simply.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The reason was the reason of a great King,
whose wisdom is as inscrutable as the wisdom
of Bel," answered Bagoas. "It was a lapse
of the mind that led me to Adam; one might
say almost an act of Providence, or to be
scientific, chance. This morning at daybreak
I had a desire to ride abroad, for I had not
slept during the night, and the sweetness of
the air enticed me into the country. I took
a falcon upon my wrist. Falconry was a
delight of my youth. But I had barely proceeded
a mile before I became preoccupied
with my own thoughts. The hares passed
me unobserved; the doves were free of the
air. I was thinking how often man has crept
up toward civilisation, and then receded from
it again, as the tides creep up and recede from
the beach; how the light of the world has
passed from nation to nation, and none have
brought it to the goal; how man forgets the
evils which the last generation had abolished,
and rushes back upon them to escape from
present evils; and it seemed to me impossible
that our race could attain to perfection in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_13'>13</span>conditions of such mutability. We sow our
wisdom with full hands. We think that it
may increase fifty-fold. Alas! some of our
seed falls in marshy places, some among stones,
some is devoured by the birds of the air, some
flourishes exceedingly, and is beaten down by
storms of hail, or withered by the fierce heat;
and that which survives and bears fruit is
scarcely sufficient for the sowing of the field
again.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Every night a priest of Bel watches the
stars; with optic glasses he explores the vast
abyss, through which the sun and its choir
of planets journey toward their fate; and
when his mind is troubled by that infinity,
his eyes seek thy city, O King, and mankind
to him is but a little heap of withered leaves,
which a sudden wind whirls in a circling dance.
From his tower, O King, he looks upon thy
city, which to us, from here, is splendid with
a multitude of lights, and murmurous with
life. He knows that in the streets the young
man is seeking pleasure, that women are bearing
children, that the old are dying. All the
wealth and misery of the world are at his
feet; and he turns again to that star which is
destined to burn up the world in a tumultuous
kiss. What is the lust of the young to him;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_14'>14</span>the pangs of child-birth; the bitterness; the
regret; the anguish of approaching death?
A little heap of withered leaves suddenly
caught up in a windy dance; a little flame,
flickering ere it goes out into darkness.</p>

<p class='c000'>"From this spirit of detachment in the
philosopher is bred a corresponding spirit of
aloofness in the multitude. They see the towers
of Bel, black against the evening sky, and the
watcher to them is but a man enamoured of the
silence, smitten with madness by the stars; a
man whose life is in the future, whose wisdom
is but a sure foreknowledge of death and fate,
whose very presence among them is a prophecy
of corruption and change; and they ask, well
may they ask! what is his wisdom worth to
us? The days are blue and gold, blue and
silver are the nights; and the birds are
clamorous among the dripping boughs; why
should we pause to think of fate? What
does his wisdom profit him when in a little
time he dies, and is equal with us in the dust?
The flowers bud, blossom, and seed, without
thought for the departing year; the birds
go delightfully upon the ways of the wind,
though the arrows which shall bring them to
earth are stored in the quiver. Shall we do
otherwise?</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_15'>15</span>"Truly the worshipper of wisdom is a lonely
man. The results which he obtains are never
the possession of the many. They may excite
the curiosity of the few, they may become an
affectation with the amateur, but they do not
touch the multitude, for to this last that only
is good which is good in its immediate effect.
Miserable indeed, the race of man seemed to
me, O King; content that their mortal
ambition should be bounded by the limits of
a day; seeking only fat pastures and pleasant
waters; and careless of the lot of their progeny,
whose fate it is to cover the whole earth with
populous cities, and stream like a river of fire,
impetuous and consuming, into hidden and
desolate places, which only the eyes of the gods
have seen as yet. The treasure of wisdom
is a treasure which is continually being lost,
rediscovered, and lost again. It is like the
gold of the miser, hidden in the ground; his
son does not inherit it, but after many years
some labourer turns it up with his deep-driven
ploughshare, and the coins ring against the
stones, and lie with tarnished brightness on
the loose earth of the furrow.</p>

<p class='c000'>"A confused murmuring distracted my
thought. I seemed to swim back to reality
out of a world of dreams. At first I thought
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>that I had approached a hive of wild bees;
but the humming murmuring noise seemed
sweeter, more bird-like, until I saw that it
came indeed from a parliament of birds, which
had congregated in the boughs of an apple-tree,
warbling there, and rising every now and
then into the air, with a great rushing of
wings, to wheel above the tree and descend
upon it again in a thick cloud. I had strayed
into a pleasant valley, where the Euphrates
flows between level meadows of wild wheat,
enclosed, like an amphitheatre, by well-wooded
hills, which had already taken on the tawny
and golden tints of autumn.</p>

<p class='c000'>"On the lower slopes grew mulberries and
oranges; above them, threaded with opulent
colouring, plane-trees and sycamores, yellowing
oaks, and the beautiful level boughs of
dusky cedars, while from all sides came the
sound of falling water, chiming and tinkling
into little hollows, or thundering in cataracts,
with a more imperious music, down precipitous
and rocky glens. The sunlit fields of ripe
wheat swayed in the wind like an undulating
sea; the river gleamed like silver, and many
coloured lilies grew beside the brimming water,
filling the air with a delicate perfume. I
looked about me in delight. It seemed a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>place sacred from the profaning feet of man.
At the same time, I had a curious sense of
being watched; and presently a young man
rose out of the wild wheat before me, and
stood watching me, with an expression of
curiosity qualified with distrust."</p>

<p class='c000'>A languid interest was apparent in the faces
of his audience.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It was Adam," said Merodach.</p>

<p class='c000'>"At last," said Queen Parysatis.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It was Adam," answered Bagoas, smiling.
"I have attempted, O King, to give you some
notion of the thoughts which preoccupied me
at my meeting with him. My outlook upon
things is historical, and therefore necessarily
pessimistic. Adam broke in upon my
thoughts as a prophecy, a promise. He was
in his first manhood, almost still a boy, and
represented, in consequence, an earlier stage
of evolution. He seemed in fact half child,
and half animal. He had the stature of a
man; he was well built, muscular, giving one
the impression of an immense but graceful
strength, of easy movements. His features
were handsome, but unlike those usual in our
country; the nose was a little rapacious, the
mouth cruel, but his eyes were full of dreams.
It was the face of one who looks towards
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>distant horizons, having the immense calm of
the desert, and full of a sleeping energy.
Youth softened it, and lent it a delicate charm;
but in age it will be terrible. And suddenly
I heard a sullen voice saying: 'This is my
garden.'</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have noticed in all nomadic peoples, and
in small scattered communities, that however
terse the language, and however limited the
vocabulary, the words are capable of innumerable
shades of meaning. Gesture and modulation
lend force and precision to what is said.
Perhaps this is why the art of the theatre is
always, at its best, the art of a naïve and
unsophisticated people. Life in town tends
to the production of a type, and individuality
is suppressed; but life in the country, where
the conventions are few and simple, tends to
the formation of character. The theatric art,
among town-dwellers, loses its broad simplicity
and that directness of purpose which show
man in immediate collision with facts, and is
frittered away in mean motives and intangible
temperaments, substituting for the play of
circumstances the play of ideas. It is for the
same reason that great empires always perish
at the heart first; because dwellers in towns
become uniform, and being surrounded by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>artificial circumstances are seldom brought into
direct conflict with facts, but learn to cheat
themselves with fine phrases and immaterial
ideas."</p>

<p class='c000'>"The good Bagoas is really a little prolix,"
whispered Parysatis to Merodach.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bagoas heard the interruption and continued
tranquilly:</p>

<p class='c000'>"'This is my garden,' said Adam; and his
words implied not only that I was an intruder,
and that he was a proprietor, but also that
the garden was beautiful, and that he was
proud of it. I explained that I had lost my
way, that I was hungry, that I was tired; and
even as I spoke a young woman rose up out
of the wheat and looked at me curiously.</p>

<p class='c000'>"'We have little,' said Adam.</p>

<p class='c000'>"They led me to their cabin of boughs, and
brought me food; and they were naked and
were not ashamed. They were strangers to
the use of fire, and my meal consisted of nuts
and honey, goat's milk and dates, such food
as, our poets say, nourished the people of the
golden age. In front of their cabin was an
apple-tree, similar to the one upon which the
birds had congregated, only with golden instead
of ruddy fruit. I asked Adam if he
would give me an apple from it.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>"'The tree is dedicated,' he said; 'and we
may not eat of the fruit; it is forbidden
to us.'</p>

<p class='c000'>"'We may not even touch it with our
hands,' said the woman, who was called Eve;
and she looked at the fruit covetously.</p>

<p class='c000'>"'To what god is it dedicated?' I enquired
of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>"'It is dedicated to God,' replied Adam
simply.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And I was surprised that this man, who had
so many needs, should have only one god;
but very soon I found that his monotheism
was but a rude crystallisation of the spiritual
forces of earth and air, a kind of shamanism,
though with the many considered as one.
His god was the god of fertility, who had
caused the earth to put forth grass, and the
trees to bear fruit, and all things to bring
forth after their kind; a god whose voice was
heard on the wind of the day, and who
breathed into man the breath of life. In his
loneliness Adam had told himself stories as
children do, and, as with children, his
imagination had laid hold with such intensity
of vision upon these fanciful adventures of his
mind that he seemed to live in a little world
of his own creating, a land of enchantment
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>and of dreams. The wind, the waters, the
leaves of the never silent trees, the birds and
the beasts of the field, all spoke in what was
to him an intelligible voice; and his god was
a being not far removed from himself, enjoying,
even as Adam himself did, the cool of
the day, the blithe air, and the breath of the
sweet flowers.</p>

<p class='c000'>"'How came it that this particular tree
should be forbidden to you?' I enquired of
them, for I was curious of the spiritual workings
of their minds.</p>

<p class='c000'>"'In the day that we came into this garden,'
answered Adam, 'I had a desire to eat of the
fruit, and I stretched my hand toward the
tree when I heard a voice upon the wind,
saying: "In the day that ye eat thereof ye
shall surely die."'</p>

<p class='c000'>"'It is curious,' I murmured. 'The fruit is
wholesome, one would think that to eat
thereof would give life rather than death.'</p>

<p class='c000'>"'If we ate of the fruit would we not die?'
enquired Eve.</p>

<p class='c000'>"'If ye ate of it you would know,' I
answered, smiling at the simplicity of the
question; and then I spoke to Adam of other
things. I love the conversation of the young,
O King. It brings back to me the time when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>I, too, had illusions, hopes, and ideals. The
sole illusions remaining to mine old age are
the illusion of life, and the hope that where
we have failed our children may succeed.
Adam believes that all men are naturally
good, and that it is society which makes them
evil; he does not see that society cannot be
different from what it is since it is a purely
natural development, and that its laws were
not made by men, but are merely a recognition
of certain instincts peculiar to mankind, and
of the effects which the exercise of these
instincts invariably produces. His point of
view is that of the individual; and the egoism
of the individual is always in conflict with the
collective egoism of the state. He believes
that men are born equal, and that society
loads them with chains. He cannot grasp
the seeming paradox that what he imagines
to be the natural man is really artificial, and
that what he imagines to be an artificial
society is really the expression of natural laws.
Adam himself is not natural, he is kindly and
hospitable to strangers, he is gentle, and
loves his wife, he is practically a monotheist.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Every individual is like Adam in this. We
are all idealists. All of us have excellent
intentions; but the world is so constituted
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>that we can never carry them out. Adam
has never been in a great city, but he has
seen from afar the huge towers of Uruk
looming into the night, and they are to him
in their proud invasion of the sky a symbol
of man's rebellion against the decrees of God,
who fashioned him to be a feeble creature,
scratching about upon the surface of the earth,
and to draw his whole being from that shallow
deposit of productive soil which he cultivates
laboriously. He considers our temples to be
the work of some demonic agency, for he
does not think it possible that beings similar
to himself should uplift these gigantic masses
into the air. Our works of pride are, therefore,
evil to him, since they differ from the
works of his native humility; to live like
Adam is to live virtuously; and that which
is different from his mode of life is evil."</p>

<p class='c000'>Here Merodach and the Queen Parysatis
laughed at the simplicity of Adam, and the
Princess Candace also laughed because she
did not understand why they were amused.
Bagoas looked at his audience with a faint
tolerant smile.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You find Adam's standard of good and
evil laughable," he said. "It is in fact a little
comic, but human, quite human, and quite
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>logical. He says in effect: 'I, Adam, am good;
those who differ from me, differ from what is
good, and are consequently evil.' This position,
which we find so laughable in others, is
really common to us all; only, unfortunately,
a sense of humour is a sense which we never
apply to ourselves. Who will deny that
Adam is wise in limiting his desires to such
things as lie easily within his reach, if happiness
be the end of wisdom? The earth gives
him of her fulness, the climate of his valley
is mild and temperate, snow does not fall
there nor is it vexed by winds; the misery
of his fellows is hidden from him, he is without
care for the morrow; in limiting his
desires he has extended the possibilities of
delight, and joy comes to him unexpectedly
as if it were a miracle wrought by God."</p>

<p class='c000'>"A charming life!" exclaimed the Queen.
"Your barbarians are like children."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes; they are like children," answered
Bagoas. "In fact they still are children,
and so I have treated them. I cast Adam's
horoscope, and read therein the wonderful
things which the stars ordain for him. In
this horoscope I read that Adam is to be
the father of a race which shall revolutionise
the world; a little obstinate people inhabiting
<span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>a country in the west toward the sea; a
people of slaves, outraged and despised, yet
leavening all the peoples among whom they
dwell. It is this race of slaves that will pass
on the light and wisdom of Chaldæa to
nations as yet unborn. While thy monuments,
O King, are sleeping beneath the
drifted sands of the desert, the name of
Adam will pass from tongue to tongue, and
distant peoples will come to think of him
as the father of the whole human race. The
arts and sciences of Uruk will be forgotten,
and the world will be duped by a record of
events which never happened, myths and
legends stolen from surrounding nations and
woven into a curious <a id='tn25'></a>asymmetrical whole, full
of contradictions and puerilities.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Truly in Adam's horoscope everything is a
contradiction. From being the happiest man,
he will become the most miserable; after a life
spent in obscurity he will achieve almost an
eternity of fame, and his children, a race of
slaves, will impose their law upon the world for
nearly two thousand years. It is incredible.
Surely my meditation as I rode toward him
was not without cause. Our wisdom, the
science of Chaldæa, is the miser's gold which
shall be lost in the earth, and whatever of us
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>survives in the memory of man will survive
through the children of Adam. I told him
nothing of this, but prophesied that he would be
a wanderer until his death, at which he smiled.</p>

<p class='c000'>"'That may not be,' he said; 'because God
has put me into this garden to dress it and
keep it.'</p>

<p class='c000'>"Then the woman filled a bowl with milk
and took it over toward the tree, and a great
bronze serpent came out from the roots of
the tree and drank the milk which she offered
him; wherefore, in spite of their monotheism,
I think that they are of the people who worship
snakes and trees, and that the tree was
taboo because of the serpent which dwelt in
its roots."</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c000'>"It may well be as you say," said Merodach,
after a silence. "Still it is curious that a
monotheist should worship snakes and trees.
Perhaps his god is the local djinn; as with
the nomadic tribes, the action of the gods is
limited to certain territories, and the wandering
herds, in changing their pastures, change
their gods also. In effect the King is the god.
He rules by divine right, he represents the
aspirations of his people, and is the visible
symbol without which all religions are but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>inarticulate yearnings. You would naturally
be interested, as a priest, in the religion of
Adam; but I am more interested in the fact
that a nomad should inhabit a garden. It
interests me, as a statesman, because it represents
the beginnings of society. A nomad
wanders for two reasons; to change his hunting
grounds, and to seek fresh pastures. Some
nomads, especially in countries where the
fertility of the soil is easily exhausted, plough,
sow, reap the harvest, and then depart into
a new place; but when fruit-trees are planted
the owner remains beside them. Their roots
have bound him to the soil. All existing
civilisations have arisen through the fact that
man gathers the fruit of a tree, and not the
tree itself."</p>

<p class='c000'>Bagoas smiled, and discreetly said nothing.</p>

<p class='c000'>"To-morrow I shall visit Adam," said
Merodach; "from the unsophisticated there
is always much to learn."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You may be disappointed," said Bagoas
gently. "I like the lowly and humble people,
and I may have prejudiced you, unwittingly,
in Adam's favour. His sincerity may seem to
you rude."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Simplicity of manner is charming,"
answered Merodach. "I believe that all our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>courtly graces, everything which is implied
by the word good breeding, have their roots
in the natural instincts of man. Of course,
the simple people move more awkwardly in
the conventional restraints; and good manners,
which we wear like jewellery, are with them
heavy fetters; but I place implicit trust in
Adam's natural good taste."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I should love to see Adam," said the
Queen Parysatis.</p>

<p class='c000'>"But he is naked," objected the Princess
Candace.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We shall bring him some leopard-skins,
such as my guards wear," said Merodach.
"Come to supper."</p>

<p class='c000'>They moved through a grove of orange-trees
towards a great pavilion where supper
was being served. Bagoas left them; and,
leaning on a balustrade, he looked over Uruk.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Certainly Adam is unfortunate," he said.</p>

<h3 class='c012'>II</h3>

<p class='c013'>Merodach went forth unto Eden, and with
him there went his wives and his concubines,
his poets and his pastry-cooks, his falconers,
his flute-players, and his players upon the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>viol, his bow-men and his spearmen; and the
number of those who followed him were ten
thousand and ten, without counting the mule-drivers,
and the camel-drivers, and the drivers
of elephants. And the noise of their going
filled the whole land, and a great cloud of dust
went up from their feet. Bagoas rode with
Merodach upon the King's elephant, whose
tusks were studded with precious stones, and
who had jewels in his ears, and Bagoas spoke
wisely unto the King.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Man is naturally vain," said Bagoas. "He
believes always that he has finally explained
the universe, and that nothing remains for him
but a life of virtue, and the approbation of a
God, who shall exalt him above his fellows.
But it seems to me, O King, that all human
systems of religion and philosophy have the
same nature as the system of a fakir whom I
once met in the desert. He told me that the
world was supported by a pillar of adamant,
which was borne by an elephant, who stood
upon the back of a tortoise."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And what supported the tortoise?"
enquired Merodach curiously.</p>

<p class='c000'>"When I asked him that question, O King,
he answered that it was a holy mystery, that
the question was blasphemous in itself, and
that all answers were equally heretical."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>The Queen Parysatis rode with the court
poet upon another elephant, and the poet,
whose name was Mekerah, made delicate
songs for her.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The old look upon the stars," sang the
poet, "they seek wisdom in the heavens;
but I look into the eyes of my beloved.
What stars are like her eyes? What wisdom
can compare with the wisdom of love?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"You have said the same thing a hundred
times," complained the Queen.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the Princess Candace rode upon a
white elephant caparisoned with cloth of
silver embroidered with pearls. No one rode
with her but the driver of the elephant, and
she sat under a canopy of silk which was
shot with the colours that are in the shell
of the pearl, and before her elephant on a
white mule rode her juggler. He rode with
his face to the tail, and juggled with oranges
and a sword; the sword meeting the oranges
in the air divided them neatly into halves,
and then again into quarters. He was a
dwarf, incredibly ugly, hunch-backed, with
long spidery arms; but the little Princess
loved him.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Look at me!" he shrilled in a falsetto
voice. "Look at me, little Princess! Who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_31'>31</span>will say that jugglery is not the supreme art?
Verily, it is the art of arts! The poet does but
juggle with words, yet he does not preserve so
perfect a rhythm. Mekerah's verses are lame,
but mine oranges do not halt; they dance in
the air with the grace of a little Princess who
dances in silver slippers before the throne of
her father. The High-priest Bagoas juggles
with theories; the Great King juggles with
the fears and passions of his subjects; the
gods juggle with our poor world, but I juggle
with mine oranges. It is the same thing.
Look at me, little Princess, look at me!"</p>

<p class='c000'>He swallowed the fragments of oranges as
they descended, and then the sword.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Uzal, you will make yourself sick," said
Candace, "and my maids will have to tend
you."</p>

<p class='c000'>The juggler stood on his head and juggled
with his feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Truly, my lord," said Bagoas, "the juggler
of the Princess has good reason for what he
says: in a sense we are all jugglers."</p>

<p class='c000'>But the King was thinking of other things,
and after a moment lifted his head.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Have you considered the Princess Candace,
how she grows?" he enquired of the High-priest.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_32'>32</span>"She is like a flower," answered Bagoas.
"She is like a silver lily opening its petals
to the sun. She grows like a flower that the
dew falls upon, and her dreams are like
dew."</p>

<p class='c000'>"A few days ago she was a child, a few
days more and she will be a woman. It is
time that she were married; but that man
whom she marries will be King after that I
am dead, and I do not wish to hasten my
death."</p>

<p class='c000'>"She is young to go down into the cave
of Ishtar," said Bagoas; "she would tremble
when the last torch was extinguished; she
would cry aloud when her husband came to
her out of that darkness. Have you considered
one worthy to be her husband, O
King?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"There is no one," answered Merodach.
"The children of my wives are all girls, and
the sons of my slaves are brawlers; men
whose words are wind."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Have you considered the son of thy cousin,
Na'amah? He is sixteen years old, and has
the heart of a lion. He is like a young lion in
his first strength. I have been the governor
of his childhood, and in his heart there is no
guile."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_33'>33</span>"We shall consider him," said Merodach.
"Beyond are the hills of Eden."</p>

<p class='c000'>"If we follow the course of the river we
shall come to Adam's garden."</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c000'>It was mid-day in Eden. The great snake
hung in the branches of the apple-tree, watching
Adam and Eve, with dull, malignant eyes
half-closed. He had shed his skin which hung
from one of the branches, swaying idly in the
wind, like a piece of grey ravelled lace; and
the great snake coiled about the trunk shone
with renewed splendour, like a bronze in which
the colours of olive and red are graduated so
as to mix and flow into each other through imperceptible
shades of difference. The shadow
of some domestic quarrel hung over Adam
and Eve; he was moved by an ungracious
solicitude for her comfort, and she received his
attentions in offended humility. The snake
watched the comedy with narrow eyes; subtilty
of enjoyment increasing the malign persistence
of his stare.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am unhappy," said Eve.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is because we have done wrong," said
Adam.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Let us go out into the desert. I do not
like this place. The water is not good; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_34'>34</span>air is heavy; it is a morass; the home of frogs
and the abode of scorpions. At night I lie
awake, looking through the door of our cabin,
and I see the moonlight lying upon the water,
and I hear a chorus of frogs; all night I hear
the croaking of the frogs. It will make me
mad."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Last night you crept into my arms and
slept like a child," said Adam. "You did not
stir all night; but I lay awake looking at the
moonlight and listening to the frogs. They
chanted a spell to fill my soul with terror, and
the moon also was full of evil. Then the
whole earth dissolved like a dream, and the
stars vanished as things that slip through
water; and I seemed to be falling, falling
through an endless sea of moonlight, falling
towards the moon, and beyond the moon
there was nothing; but I felt you in mine
arms, and I did not dare to move, lest you,
too, should vanish with the world. This vision
was sent to me by God that I might learn
how unsubstantial is the world, as if it were
but the shadow of His thought, a dream within
a dream."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Do not let us talk of it," said Eve,
trembling. "Perhaps if I had not been here
you would have fallen into nothing. It was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>because you held me that you did not fall.
This place will make me mad. Why are the
leaves falling from the trees?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I do not know."</p>

<p class='c000'>"The palm-trees in the desert do not lose
their leaves. My heart is sick for the palm-trees
in the desert with the little slender moon
shining above them, and shining at the bottom
of the deep wells. My heart is sick for the
song of the nightingales. Why have the tops
of the mountains turned white?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I do not know," answered Adam; "but
once I saw from the desert a range of
mountains, and their tops were white. They
also had trees; but the leaves of the trees did
not fall. These trees must be dead. Some
great unhappiness is come upon the world.
Last night I was cold."</p>

<p class='c000'>"The sand of the desert is always warm,"
said Eve.</p>

<p class='c000'>"O Eve, I am unhappy," said Adam, after
a silence; "I do not know what has come
upon the world. Last night when you crept
into mine arms I was troubled; never before
have I been troubled while you were with
me; but last night, when you touched me, I
trembled. I was unhappy, and I did not
know why I was unhappy; but I feared to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>lose you, Eve. Though I touched you it
seemed that you were far away. You were
but a child when I first saw you with your
mother; and I was twelve years old. It was
last moon that we came together again; in
the day that the djinns came down from the
mountains and slew our kinsfolk. I was
pasturing the sheep, and as I came back,
leading my flock with my pipe, I saw the
dying embers and the dead bodies. Then you
called to me, and we fled together. Do you
remember? That night we slept in the desert.
I did not tremble when you touched me.
You will never leave me, Eve? We are alone
in the world. There are only ourselves, and
the angels and the djinns."</p>

<p class='c000'>"The djinn who came to us yesterday has
made us unhappy," said Eve. "He has
withered the trees and made the tops of
the mountains white."</p>

<p class='c000'>"He was not a djinn," said Adam; "he was
an angel. He smelt of roses, his raiment was
wonderful, he was clothed in glory."</p>

<p class='c000'>"What is that noise?" said Eve. "What
is that pillar of cloud that goeth up out of
the earth?"</p>

<p class='c000'>And they saw in the distance the army of
Merodach, and, being afraid, they fled.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>"It is a pleasant site," said Merodach,
as the elephants entered the valley; "the
autumnal landscapes have always a certain
melancholy which charms me."</p>

<p class='c000'>"The fallen leaves in the valleys are like
fallen light," said Mekerah; "that slender
birch flamed yellow a moment ago, but, at
a touch, went out in a shower of sparks."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It must be delightfully cool in summer,"
said the Queen Parysatis.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The best time is the spring," said the
Princess Candace.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The almond and cherry blossom will be
out then," said Mekerah; "these slopes will
be all pink and white, with petals drifting
in the wind. The hyacinths and daffodils
will be out then; and the red flower of
Tammuz will fall upon the river."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I should like to come here in the spring,
and go naked, and live in a cabin of boughs
like Adam," said the Princess Candace.</p>

<p class='c000'>Adam could not be found. Merodach
ordered that his men should encircle the
whole valley, and drive whatever game there
was toward him.</p>

<p class='c000'>"In this way, if he is still here we shall
find him; and in any case we shall have some
sport."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>Then the servants of Merodach drove all
the game that was in Eden past the elephant
of the Great King; and Merodach pierced the
beasts and the birds with his arrows, and the
herds of Adam were scattered in the wilderness,
bleating dispersedly, and the hollow
caves answered their bleating, while the ewes
sought their lambs, and the she-goats the
kids of the flock. But Adam, the servants
of Merodach could not find. Then the slaves
erected a pavilion of purple silk, upon which
was embroidered the whole story of Ut-Napishtim
and the flood; the gods cowering
like dogs at the fury of Rimmon, while
Ishtar cried like a woman in travail, and
the Anunnaki brought lightnings; and the
race of man strewn like leaves upon the
waters; and the waters like a great host
rioting in the fury of battle, white-plumed
squadrons of angry and tumultuous waves.
Yea, and therein was figured Ut-Napishtim
looking from the window of the ark; and
the sending forth of the birds, the sending
of the dove, the sending of the swallow, and
the sending of the raven, who saw the
decrease of the waters, and ate, and waded,
and croaked, and turned not back. And
there was embroidered upon it the bow which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>Ishtar hung in the heavens, and the sacrifice
which Ut-Napishtim offered unto the gods
upon the mountain, setting Adagur vases
seven by seven, strewing reeds, cedar-wood,
and incense before them, so that the gods
smelt the goodly savour, and gathered like
flies over the sacrifice. The Princess Candace
was delighted with the tapestry, which she
had never seen before. Mekerah told her
the story, handling the details with rare
imagination, while the Princess ate larks
stuffed with cherries. Then she turned toward
Bagoas.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Priest of Bel," she said, "how long is it
since all this trouble came upon the world?"</p>

<p class='c000'>And Bagoas smiled faintly, his smile expressive
of many things.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It happened, little Princess, in the time
when the animals spoke with the tongues of
men."</p>

<p class='c000'>But the Princess found this chronology too
vague.</p>

<p class='c000'>"When did the animals speak the language
of men?" she enquired.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is all a tale, little Princess. The
animals never spoke as men do; but once upon
a time the speech of men was like that of
animals."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>"Then it never happened?" enquired the
Princess regretfully.</p>

<p class='c000'>"No; it never happened," answered Bagoas.</p>

<p class='c000'>But the King was outraged, for he claimed
to be descended from Ut-Napishtim.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Candace," he said, "the story is quite true.
Gilgamesh builded a ship and pitched it within
and without, and he took with him Ia-bani,
and some chosen comrades, and journeyed over
the waters which engirdle the earth, and he
crossed the river of death, which flows round
these waters without mixing with them, and
he landed in the country of the shades. Then
he dug a trench, and cut the throat of a black
bull so that the blood flowed into the trench,
and the shades flocked to drink of the warm
blood; but Gilgamesh drove them from it
with his sword until Ut-Napishtim came to
drink of it, and had drank his fill. And of
all these who came to drink of it only Ut-Napishtim
and his wife had life and substance;
but all the others were unsubstantial shades.
Then Ut-Napishtim told Gilgamesh all the
things which had befallen him in this life, and
how that the gods had given him and his wife,
alone of all human kind, imperishable bodies
and immortal youth; but he said it was sad
to dwell among the shades, whom he could
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>not touch with his hands, and to see loved
faces, which, whenever the wind blew, lost
their remembered contours, and became as
wreaths of vapour drifting over the desolate
marshes. And he bade Gilgamesh to make
haste and get him into his ship again, for that
if night found him there, he would become
even as the shades himself, and his bones would
rot by the bitter flood. Then Gilgamesh
made haste into his ship with his companions,
and they lifted the creaking sail, and bent to
the oars, and departed over the sea. But
Ut-Napishtim stood upon the beach where
the waves broke at his feet, and his eyes
strained after the vessel; for he was like an
exile there, who sees a ship bound to his own
country, and his heart goes with it. So the
body of Ut-Napishtim stood upon the beach,
but his heart was with the living offspring of
his race; for a long time he stood thus, until
the ship was a mere speck on the waters, while
tears blinded his eyes; then he sighed and
went back into the shadowy ways of that
twilit land."</p>

<p class='c000'>His audience listened to Merodach with
astonishment, his voice was full of emotion.
He had hurried through the story, careless of
whither it led him, like a man blind with grief,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>who stumbles against all the obstacles in his
path. When he had finished there was
silence.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And Gilgamesh," he added after a pause,
"wrote all these things in a book, which is
preserved in the Temple of Bel at Nippur."</p>

<p class='c000'>He glanced at Bagoas indignantly as he
spoke. Bagoas was eating a dish of leverets
stewed with rice and prunes; he looked up
from his plate, and wiped his mouth with a
fine napkin.</p>

<p class='c000'>"There is preserved in our Temple at Nippur
a book which purports to be the work of
Gilgamesh," he said. "It is the work of a
poet, such a history as Mekerah might invent
for you, which it would be ridiculous to consider
as a true and serious narrative of actual
events."</p>

<p class='c000'>Mekerah caught a malicious glance from the
Queen Parysatis, and rose angrily.</p>

<p class='c000'>"There is, O Priest, a higher truth and a
higher seriousness," he said. "In the epic
of Gilgamesh is enshrined the religious consciousness
of Babylonia. It is sacred. It is
not to be touched. It contains those great
truths which are not a peculiar feature of any
one age, but are true for all time. It was
directly inspired by Bel, and shall we set our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>pitiful human wisdom above the wisdom of
the divine word?"</p>

<p class='c000'>Bagoas once again wiped his mouth before
he began to speak.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I deny," he said, "that it has any truth
as an historical document. It is valuable,
historically, as an instance of the narrow
limits of human knowledge in the age which
produced it. That is all its value to the
historian. Its value to the theologian is
different. He finds in it the first concrete
expression of man's relation to God, as he
understands it. The truth may be veiled in
a mist of fable and metaphor, but he feels
it to be there. At the same time, he gives
it an extended sense, and interprets it in a
larger spirit than that in which it was originally
interpreted. It means to us at once
something more and something less than it
did to the ancient world; for religion is not
a definite revelation of an eternal truth, but
the contemplation of the unknown from the
sum of man's experience. It is consequently
susceptible of infinite development
and extension, it reacts to every new discovery
of science; and its chief glory is that it is
part of man's daily life.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We, the priests of Bel, recognise our sacred
<span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>books as the starting-point of a living, growing
truth; in our hands is the duty of interpreting
it, and our interpretation is of the nature of
a commentary. We are continually rejecting
some details as unsound, and developing others
to the utmost limits of their power; that is our
value and duty as an hierarchy: to criticise, to
prune, to graft. And if we consider the nature
of the books, in which are enshrined those great
spiritual truths, we see how necessary this work
of selection and rejection is; for they do not
form one inseparable, concrete whole, but each
has arisen under the impulse of different circumstances,
each had its own separate development
and origin before it became joined on to the
main body.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Before philosophy came into being men
spoke in fables, and their minds, not being
able to grasp as yet the significance of abstract
ideas, dealt exclusively with things and actions.
They were curious of the destiny of man after
death, and they felt the need for some answer,
so they imagined the hero, the Babylonian
semi-divinity, Gilgamesh, setting out on a
ship fashioned by human hands to bring them
back the answer which they needed. For us
it was the first voyage of man's mind into
the unknown, the first adventure beyond the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>realm of actualities, and as such it demands
our reverence. We do not, however, believe
either in Gilgamesh, Ia-bani, or the ship which
crossed the river of death. The story is a
mere fable, and the actions described in it
are only the unconscious vehicles of a half-recognised
truth, or rather of the germ of a
new spirit. There is only one form of truth,
and one form of seriousness."</p>

<p class='c000'>He drank a little wine.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Let us walk in the garden," said Merodach.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c000'>Merodach, after a moment's consideration,
found that the conclusions of Bagoas with
reference to the epic of Gilgamesh were
reasonable, so he conversed with the High-priest
amiably as they walked by the river.
The Princess Candace interrupted the conversation.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yesterday was my birthday, and you have
given me no present, now let me ask one,"
she said.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ask then," said Merodach, smiling.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Give me this garden to be my garden,
and build me a palace where Adam had his
cabin of boughs; a little palace of blue porcelain,
which I may visit in the spring, and in
the hot months of the year, and set at all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_46'>46</span>the entrances into the valley great winged
cherubim, that the wandering tribes may see
that it is a royal palace, and fear to enter."</p>

<p class='c000'>"So be it," said the King; and the Princess
went off to inspect the site of the new palace.</p>

<p class='c000'>"She is discreet, and charming, wise beyond
her years," said Merodach. "We shall consider
the son of Na'amah, my cousin, at
Nippur. How is he called?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"His name is Adamaharon," answered
Bagoas, smiling; "and he is even now on his
way to visit me at Uruk, where he has never
been. He may turn aside to hunt. It is his
ambition at present to kill a lion, for which
he has a permit from the King's huntsman."</p>

<p class='c000'>"He shall hunt with me," said the King;
"but the Princess is still a little young for
marriage."</p>

<p class='c000'>She, unconscious of her fate, drew close to
the cabin of Adam. That part of the valley
had been deserted by the King's servants, and
she was alone. She saw the glitter of a spear
which lay in the doorway, and then the eyes
of a young man watching her.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I came for an apple," she said, turning
toward the tree in the branches of which the
great snake hung; "but Adam must have
eaten them all."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_47'>47</span>"There is one at the top of the tree," said
the boy. "Look! right at the top."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is too high. Perhaps you could knock
it down with your spear?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"That would bruise it. I shall climb up
and get it for you."</p>

<p class='c000'>He swung himself up, avoiding the great
snake which looked at him warily.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Do not go any higher," cried the Princess;
"the branch will break, and you will be killed."</p>

<p class='c000'>But he laughed at her, and climbing higher
seized the apple, then the branch did break.
She screamed a little.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You are bruised instead of the apple," she
said, as he picked himself up.</p>

<p class='c000'>He laughed.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have done wonderful things to-day," he
said. "At dawn I killed a lion; and at eve
I got an apple for a Princess."</p>

<p class='c000'>"But are you not one of the court-pages?
I thought you were. Who are you to kill
lions, which are preserved for the King?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am Adamaharon, the son of Na'amah,
the cousin of the King."</p>

<p class='c000'>She offered him the apple, and he bit a
large piece out of it.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Come and look at the lion's skin," he said,
and led her into Adam's cabin. She felt a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_48'>48</span>curious pleasure in being with him, and
listened with delight to the story of how he
killed the lion. But they did not talk much,
they seemed to understand each other so well
that they had nothing to say; and at last they
kissed each other.</p>

<p class='c000'>It was at that precise moment, when their
souls seemed to meet with their lips that
Merodach entered. For a moment he paused,
anger falling about him like darkness in which
all things writhed, confused. Then he drew
his sword. The Princess Candace fell before
him and embraced his knees; he was lifting
the sword to strike her when Bagoas seized
his arm.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is the son of Na'amah," he said quickly.</p>

<p class='c000'>The King paused, and then lowered his
sword slowly. He stared at the young man
in silence, and the young man met his gaze
quietly. Then the King let his eyes wander
over the other's form, and he saw that the
young man was well-thewed, spare, and
muscular, with a beauty to make him desired
of the maidens; and his heart softened toward
his cousin's son.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You are Adamaharon," he said slowly,
as he sheathed his sword. "I had intended
to send for you to come unto Uruk, that I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>might wed you to my daughter. This is the
will of the gods, and it is mine, also."</p>

<p class='c000'>The young man came to him, and bowed
down before, touching his feet; and Merodach
let his hand rest upon the bowed head, caressing
the thick curls.</p>

<p class='c000'>"A young lion of our race," said Merodach
exultingly; "look at the yellow mane rippling
over the firm neck. A child of my cousin
Na'amah. A child of the race of the gods."</p>

<p class='c000'>And he embraced Adamaharon kindly, and
he raised up Candace and kissed her fondly,
bidding her go to her mother, and tell her
how she had found a husband in the cabin
of Adam. And Candace left them; and as
she went she wept, for her fear had given
place to joy. Then Adamaharon rose up,
and stood before the King.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have done wonderful things to-day," he
said proudly. "At dawn I slew a lion; and
at eve I kissed the desire of my heart. My
mouth is filled with honey."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is the will of the gods," said Merodach.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then he began to lead the son of Na'amah
toward the river where the Queen Parysatis
was listening to her daughter's tale; but
Bagoas paused before the apple-tree and
looked into the eyes of the great serpent.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>"It is the will of the gods," he said, with
his ironical smile. "I am but their minister,
the mere instrument of their designs; so what
part shall I claim in this adventure?"</p>

<p class='c000'>The snake watched him fixedly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The boy is like a son to me," said Bagoas.
"He was born to be fortunate."</p>

<p class='c000'>And then he followed them toward the
river, leaving the wise snake wreathed in the
branches of the fruitless tree.</p>

<p class='c000'>On the journey back to Uruk the three
royal elephants walked abreast. Adamaharon
rode with Merodach, Bagoas with the Princess
Candace, and the Queen Parysatis with her
attendant poet. And Adamaharon made
delicate songs for his beloved.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The old look upon the stars," he sang;
"but I look into the eyes of my beloved.
What stars are like her eyes? What wisdom
can compare with the wisdom of love?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"He is a true poet," said Parysatis to
Mekerah. "What spirit, what fire!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have said the same thing an hundred
times," said Mekerah crossly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Precisely," said Parysatis; "he has said
it once, perfectly."</p>

<p class='c000'>"The kisses of her mouth are sweeter than
honey," sang Adamaharon; "more fragrant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>than apples. She has filled me with the joy of
morning, and gladdened my soul as with wine."</p>

<p class='c000'>Bagoas leaned toward the Queen's elephant.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Adam said of love that----"</p>

<p class='c000'>But the Queen put a finger on her lips.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I do not believe that Adam ever existed,"
she said.</p>

<p class='c000'>Bagoas, looking at Candace, smiled.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c000'>But many years afterwards a woman sitting
by the door of a hut in the desert, watching
the quiet stars quicken as the day died, drew
two young boys toward her, and told them
the story of the garden. Her face was
tranquil, like the face of one who has grief
for a companion; and the boys were clothed
in goat-skins.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And," she said, looking into the embers
of the fire, "the man counselled me to eat,
saying, if ye eat of the fruit ye shall know."</p>

<p class='c000'>Adam suddenly appeared in the firelight.
He had heard the last words.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It was the serpent," he said suspiciously.
"You always told me it was the serpent."</p>

<p class='c000'>And Eve answered quickly, drawing her
children closer to her.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yea, it was the serpent! I forgot. It
was the serpent!"</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>II<br /> <br />AT THE HOUSE OF EURIPIDES</h2>
</div>

<p class='c006'>Euripides ordered the tables to be removed,
and then some musicians entered, followed by
a girl, who danced as Persephone among the
flowers of Enna. While the guests were
admiring the grace of her gestures, and the
swift movements of her thin, naked feet,
Callias came in with Lysis and Antisthenes.
They had been unable to come earlier; and
after making their excuses to Euripides,
Callias and Antisthenes took a couch close
by Protagoras, and Lysis went to Socrates.
The company included Glaucon, Hermogenes,
Pythodorus, Philip the buffoon, who never
missed a feast, and Apollodorus, the friend
of Socrates. Protagoras had a couch to himself
on the right of Euripides, who was also
without a companion. Others came in during
the evening until the room was very full.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_56'>56</span>When the girl had finished her dance there
was a murmur of admiration, and she leaned
back on the bench, smiling with pleasure,
her slim body trembling and palpitating
beneath its crocus-coloured veils.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You are magnificent, Euripides," said
Socrates. "You not only feast us sumptuously;
but you amuse us with dancing and
music."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am glad that you are amused, Socrates.
Why are you so silent to-night?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I feel like one about to be initiated into
the mysteries. When there are so many
older and wiser men than myself present I
listen rather than talk. It is more interesting.
I wish that I had come with flowers and
ribbons like Lysis, so that I might have
occupied myself in making a garland. Are
you going to crown Protagoras when he has
read his discourse, Lysis?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, Socrates; Callias said it would be
worthy of a crown."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Protagoras must be the happiest of men."
said Socrates. "He has health, riches, and
honour from all. I am impatient to hear
what he has to say."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am old," said Protagoras, "and like to
rest a little while after eating; but I shall
<span class='pageno' id='Page_57'>57</span>not keep you long. In the meantime,
why do you not have a discussion with
Euripides?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well, as you have given me leave to
speak, I should like to ask Euripides a few
questions."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Very well," said Euripides.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Do not encourage him," shouted Philip.
"If he once begins asking questions we shall
not know where we are. He will tell us that
Protagoras is not Protagoras, and that this
banquet is not a banquet."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Why do you attack me like this, Philip?
What harm have I ever done to you?" said
Socrates.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Why, ever since you have taken to frequenting
the tables of the rich you have
done me harm," said Philip, with a pretence
to excitement. "At one time I was always
a welcome guest; but since you have come
upon the scene no one laughs at me. Your
talk is all about justice, wisdom, and virtue.
What does a poor man like myself know of
such things? But these are all that amuse
the company now; and, if I want a dinner
in mine old age, I shall have to play the
sophist too."</p>

<p class='c000'>Philip was a great favourite with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_58'>58</span>company, and his exaggerated gestures as he
railed at Socrates amused them extremely.
He advanced into the middle of the room.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Laugh at me as you will," he cried; "it
is true. Socrates cannot deny it. The more
wine a man has now, the more solemn he
looks; until sometimes I think I have strayed
to a funeral instead of to a feast. If I chose,
I could be the greatest sophist of you all. I
should teach you not only the knowledge of
good, and truth, and virtue, but the knowledge
of all things."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And how would you teach us, Philip?"
said Socrates; "for this is precisely the knowledge
which I have been seeking all my life.
By the dog of Egypt, if you would teach me
this I should ever afterwards obey you in
all things. I have always had the greatest
respect for you, Philip, but I did not think
that philosophy was among your accomplishments."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Do you answer me, Socrates? and I shall
prove it to you."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Willingly," said Socrates; "but I am
afraid you are going to make me ridiculous.
I have never pretended to be a sophist, nor,
indeed, to know anything."</p>

<p class='c000'>Philip stood in the middle of the room, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>the company all leant forward, looking at him
with amusement.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Is knowledge the knowledge of something,
or the knowledge of nothing?" he enquired
of Socrates.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Of both," answered Socrates.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You will not escape me that way,"
exclaimed Philip. "Would you not rather
say it is the knowledge of something, and the
knowledge of not knowing other things?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Very well, Philip."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Then there is a knowledge of knowing,
and a knowledge of not knowing; and we
know the things we know, and the things we
do not know?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"That seems absurd," said Socrates.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What? Will you go back on the argument,
Socrates, and say that knowledge is
only the knowledge of something?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Let us try that way then," Socrates said.</p>

<p class='c000'>"By Zeus, Socrates, that way will do as
well as another," said Philip; "for if you
know something you can distinguish it from
other things, can you not?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You can distinguish one thing you know,
from another thing you know; and both from
what you do not know."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>"You have made me giddy, Philip. Let
me think."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well, Socrates, you can distinguish
Euripides from Protagoras, can you not?
And you can distinguish both these people
whom you know, from the tyrant Archelaus,
whom you do not know?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Certainly; I must agree to that."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Then you can distinguish between something
you know and something you do not
know?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Consider a moment, Socrates. Is it
possible for you to know the difference
between one thing and another unless you
know both things?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Why, no! I must admit that," said
Socrates.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Then mark where I lead you; for if you
know the things you know, you must also
know the things you do not know."</p>

<p class='c000'>Every one was now laughing immoderately;
not only at Philip's dialectic, but at his
pompous gestures, wherewith he mimicked
many well-known sophists; blowing out his
cheeks, pursing his lips, tapping his head
suspiciously, and rubbing his nose.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>"By the dog of Egypt!" cried Socrates;
"the man has been with Euthydemus."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Euthydemus is a child to me," said Philip
contemptuously.</p>

<p class='c000'>"But, Philip, if I confess I know nothing?"
said Socrates, when the laughter failed a little.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Why, then, Socrates, I shall not argue the
question with you; though I could easily
prove to you that if you knew nothing you
would know everything."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Philip, I have always asserted my ignorance.
It is my ignorance which causes me to ask
questions. And now, as you have proved that
you know everything, I want to ask you what
knowledge is. Can you tell me?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"This talking has made me thirsty, Socrates,
and I am going to seek for truth in the wine,
where the proverb says it may be found. I
shall talk no more."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well, then, I shall ask my question of
Euripides, if you will allow me."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ask, by all means!" said Philip; "but if
your questions are to be about knowledge and
virtue I shall go and sit with the flute-girls,
and we shall talk of something that we can
understand."</p>

<p class='c000'>Socrates settled himself more comfortably
upon the couch, and, taking up one of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>ribbons which Lysis had brought, turned it
about his fingers.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Protagoras is going to tell us whether we
can have any knowledge of the gods or not,"
he said; "but let us enquire into their nature,
assuming that we know them, for the present.
Shall we examine your own conception of God,
Euripides? It will clear matters up if we
are able to say what the gods whom we seek
to know are like."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Very well, Socrates," said Euripides.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You live at the centre of things, Euripides,"
said Socrates; "and every aspect of
our modern thought is clearly reflected in
your work. This is one reason why I have
always been an admirer of your plays; but it
has its drawbacks, for sometimes you reflect
two distinct and opposed theories, so that
your meaning is not quite clear. Your treatment
of the myths is, in reality, a criticism
of the myths, is it not?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes."</p>

<p class='c000'>"The dramatist takes a myth as his material,
and by working upon it, criticising it, rejecting
some features, and developing others, he will
make it into a play, and not only does he deal
with the myth itself in this way, but he also
examines and criticises each character in it,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_63'>63</span>using the same method, so that his play is
not only a representation of the myths but
a criticism of them as well. Now I have
lately been reading your Hippolytus again,
so that we shall take that as an example.
The myth is very simple: Aphrodite wishes
to be avenged upon Hippolytus, who neglects
her worship in preference for the worship of
Artemis; and in order to compass the death
of the young man she stirs up an unholy
passion in Phædra. Hippolytus refuses the
love of Phædra, and, in despair, she kills herself,
leaving a writing behind which accuses
Hippolytus of having forced her. Theseus,
discovering this writing, calls down upon
Hippolytus one of the three curses which
Poseidon has promised him to fulfil, and
Hippolytus is slain. Then Artemis reveals
the truth to Theseus, and before Hippolytus
dies Theseus is forgiven by him.</p>

<p class='c000'>"This story is full of improbable and supernatural
conditions, the jealousy of Aphrodite,
the apparition of Artemis, and the intervention
of Poseidon. We no longer imagine the gods
as beings with the same passions as men; but
the passions and strife of the gods are the
essential feature of some myths. Do you
think, Euripides, that the makers of myths in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_64'>64</span>the old days simply dragged in the gods,
in order to explain any tragedy which was
quite inexplicable in itself, and that they
attempted to alleviate in this way the sense
of waste with which a tragedy fills us?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"It seems a plausible supposition, Socrates.
If men cannot relate an event to any known
cause, they consider it sufficiently explained
if it be attributed to a deity."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And so it happens," said Socrates, "that
many evil deeds are attributed to the gods;
the death of Hippolytus, for instance, to the
jealousy of Aphrodite. Do you think, Euripides,
that the makers of myths and the
common people believe that evil is not
inherent in the action itself, but depends
upon the quality and nature of the agent?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes," answered Euripides; "they imagine
that actions are permissible in gods which
would not be permissible in man; that the
gods have a right to do evil, since they have
the power. On the contrary, I maintain, that
a god is all goodness, and that if he revenged
himself on man, or were guilty of jealousy and
hatred, he would cease, by that fact, to be a
god."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And is it because you hold this opinion
<span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>that you make the action in your play of
Hippolytus, as far as possible, move independently
of the gods?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"How do you mean, Socrates?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I mean, Euripides, that your play seems
to present two sides: the action as it is
presented in the original myth, and the action
which is the result of your criticism. There
are some people who say that if you are not
content with the myths, you should invent
your own stories; but this would defeat your
object which is purely critical, and which aims
at presenting another version of the story.
You seem to say to yourself: the myth presents
the gods as beings with the same
appetites, passions, and desires as mortals,
and so I shall treat them. They are to you
mere characters in the play, and even subordinate
characters at that. You introduce
Aphrodite to speak the prologue, and thus,
ostensibly following the myth, make her
responsible for the catastrophe. But at the
same time you show that the catastrophe
is directly precipitated by the hastiness of
Theseus; a fatal flaw which he himself recognises,
and laments when it is too late. He
was over-hasty to use the gift of Poseidon,
he says; but Hippolytus answers that if he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>had not used that method of revenge, he
would have found another. Theseus implicitly
agrees to this, when he says that some lying
spirit had blinded him to the truth, and thus
the guilt is flung back upon Aphrodite, whom
Artemis promises to punish by slaying Adonis.
In reality, Euripides, the lying spirit is not
Aphrodite, but Phædra; and you take care
that Artemis should point this out. Thus,
at every part of the myth where the action
of the divinities is supposed to be clearly
visible, you present us with another version
and another cause; and, by this means, not
only do you make the development of the
plot more plausible, and fill us with admiration
for your genius, but ultimately you
remove the responsibility from the gods, by
showing that the action of the play is not
dependent upon them. Aphrodite seems to
be only the incarnation of Phædra's desire,
and Poseidon of a father's curse. Artemis,
it is true, has a separate existence, and is not
merely the personification of a mortal passion;
she exists in order that she may reveal the
truth to Theseus, and for that purpose, had
you not been bound by tradition, the nurse
would have done as well. You say, too, in
one of the choruses that the thought of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>gods consoles your grief, and that your hope
clings to the belief in a supreme reason; but
that when you consider the deeds and the
fate of men you are confounded. Do you
think, Euripides, that the whole evil of life
comes from man alone, and that the gods
are not implicated in it?"</p>

<p class='c000'>Protagoras smiled. Euripides leaned forward,
looking at Socrates with bright eyes
from beneath his bent brows.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The words of the chorus, Socrates, mean
that when I consider the wretchedness and
the doom of men, I doubt the existence of a
supreme reason, or at least waver in my
belief."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Of course I see that," answered Socrates;
"but if you accept the idea of a universal
mind animating all things, why should the
misery and wretched conditions of the life of
men dissipate this idea? Your play shows
that it is man's own folly, and not the anger of
the gods, that punishes him with misfortune.
Theseus in ignorance calls down the doom of
death upon Hippolytus, and thus brings evil
upon himself. It is the lust of Phædra, and
the blind anger of Theseus, which are responsible
for the death of the innocent; but is it
better to have suffered unjustly as Hippolytus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>suffered, or to die in shame, despised, as
Phædra died, or to live as Theseus lived in
misery, though forgiven?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I agree to what you have said of my play,"
answered Euripides, his worn, melancholy face
illuminated with a smile; "and I agree, also,
that it was my purpose to deny that the gods
do evil, and to make people dissatisfied with
the myths. I misunderstood the reason for
your use of what the chorus says about the
Supreme Mind; the doings of men seem to
me to be more the result of the conditions of
life than of their own wickedness. If men err
it is through ignorance; but they suffer quite
independently of their deserts. It is through
my sympathy with mankind that I am led
into doubt. Man struggles all his life with
the fluctuations and vicissitudes of fortune; his
pleasures are but phantoms and visions which
elude his grasp; the one certainty before him
is death: an unknown terror. Why has he
been set among this play of circumstance, over
which he has no control, but which whirls him
away like a dead leaf upon the ripples and eddies
of a river? The best happiness we can find in
life is resignation, a folding of the hands, a
withdrawal into the interior peace of our own
minds, the serene heights which the Muses
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>inhabit. Those who have gained that sanctuary
have at least the happiness which comes from
a knowledge of the limitations of life; they
have learned to desire little, to delight in
natural and simple things, the bright air, the
coolness of forests, wind rippling the waves
of corn and setting the poplar leaves a-tremble;
but, alas! behind even this serenity
of mind is the shadow of human suffering.
So few are the wise, and so many the miserable!
We would not, if we could, cut
ourselves off from the dumb herd of humanity,
with its obscure sufferings, its vague desires,
its inarticulate and eternal pain."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I should not ask it of you, Euripides," said
Socrates gently.</p>

<p class='c000'>He had a real love for Euripides, a real
admiration for the mind which through its
own tumult and discord had come at last into
the possession of peace, and to the vision of a
clear hope.</p>

<p class='c000'>"If mankind with its blind follies makes
me doubt the existence of a God," continued
Euripides, "its miseries make me believe in
one. I am not an enemy of knowledge;
I have sought it with diligence all the days of
my life; but we have other needs. We
suffer with one another; there is a trouble
<span class='pageno' id='Page_70'>70</span>and perplexity in the world from which we
cannot escape, and to which we cannot refuse
sympathy, pity, and love. Religion does not
take into sufficient account the fact, that however
diverse are the activities of men, all suffer
alike. We have the corporate religious unity
of the State, and it presents to us the noble
and lofty ideas of the Olympian deities. Do
you remember, Socrates, the fable which
Protagoras made for you, describing how at
first men had only the arts, and warred
among themselves until Zeus sent them the
gifts of justice and reverence?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes; I remember it. I cannot, of course,
remember all that Protagoras said," answered
Socrates. "Long speeches puzzle me. But
I remember that it was beautiful."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It was at my house," said Callias, with
some pride.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well, Socrates, it seems to me that justice
and reverence were not enough. Man needed
something more. So the worship of Demeter
and Dionysos was revealed to him. I have
sometimes meditated writing a play about
Dionysos, the enthusiasm of wine, of poetry,
the Deliverer, who uplifts the heart of man;
or about Demeter, the Earth, the herbage and
the ripe corn, through whom we are kin, not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_71'>71</span>only with each other but with the beasts of
the field, the cattle grazing in their fat
pasture, and the young fawn couched among
the briars and thickets of the forest. These
divinities seem closer to us than the ruler of
the sun or the lord of the sea. They move
gently among us, coming and going with the
seasons, filling our granaries and wine-jars
with their mystical gifts; corn and wine, their
very bodies and blood, through which we
enter into a close and intimate communion
with them, and become indeed their children,
or even themselves, as when their spirit possesses
us entirely, and with a wild enthusiasm
we range through the wooded hills, clothed
in spotted fawn-skins, crowned with dark
ivy, shaking the thyrsus in the air, and leaping
to the sound of timbrels and pipes, and the
brazen cymbals of the Great Mother.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The Olympian divinities have given to man
the knowledge of the arts, and instilled into
him the principles of justice and of reverence;
they are untouched by the sense of our
human mortality.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Of old, the poets say, they visited mortals;
and coming to a house at dusk in the guise of
huntsmen or travellers would rest that night
to share the evening meal, and at dawn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_72'>72</span>depart again, leaving behind them strange
gifts. Now they come among us no more.
But these divinities of our own delightful
earth, how different they are! Our mortality,
our labours, and our desires are part of their
ritual. They have shown man that he is one
with that earth from which he derives his
being, and which receives him again, after
the toils and vicissitudes of life, as with the
gentle enfolding arms of a mother; and that
through it he is one also with them. They
give him, in the recurrence of seed-time and
harvest, the symbolism of the vine and the
vintage, the return of Spring, coming with
frail, delicate flowers, and troops of swallows,
in the first flush of green over the ploughlands,
hints and foreshadowings of some such
resurrection for himself; until death ceases
to be a nameless terror to him, but is like
a little interval of sleep not entirely barren of
dreams. How natural they are too!</p>

<p class='c000'>"We should not be surprised if we met with
Demeter, clad in blue raiment, in a cornfield,
as the dawn was breaking. It would
not seem strange to see her, plucking the
golden ears, and weaving them into a garland
for her head; or resting beside a well of bright
water, and looking over the misty fields with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>quiet, thoughtful eyes. It would not seem
strange if Dionysos appeared suddenly to us,
coming through the shadowy woods between
the straight stems of the pines, light in his
eyes, and the wind lifting the hair from his
cool brow; or to meet him leading his troop
of delirious worshippers by the banks of
Asopus, or up the steep glens of Cithæron.
If she, Earth, be a mother to us, he is like an
elder brother, born of a mortal woman, and
so closer to us. It is true, Socrates, that the
myths dealing with him contain much that
is revolting, and are full of tragic and sinister
episodes; but behind the veil of man's weaving
is a figure of singular beauty, wild but gentle;
a divinity who promises to the restless and
troubled spirit of man joy in life and peace
after death."</p>

<p class='c000'>His words made an impression upon the
company. There was silence for the moment.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well, Euripides, I shall not question you
any further to-night," said Socrates. "We
have agreed that the idea of divinity is
exclusive of all evil; and now Protagoras
will probably tell us that the philosophic
question of the present time is not whether
the gods are good or evil, but whether they
exist at all."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>Protagoras made no further delay. He had
a roll of parchment in his hand, but scarcely
referred to it. There was a movement among
the guests as he began, for all were curious
to hear what he had to say.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c000'>"We cannot know whether the gods exist
or do not exist; the matter is too obscure, and
man's life too short. If they exist, it must be
in some manner peculiar to themselves, for
we cannot find any trace of their presence in
the world. They are not present to us as
objects to be perceived by the senses; if they
move among us at all it is by stealth, and
without leaving so much trace as a ship leaves
upon the waves. But man has always believed
that they are close to him, and has come to
imagine them as haunting every green corner
of the earth, each well, and wood, and hill,
the blue depths of the sea and the wide regions
of the air. We have a God to preside at our
sowing and at our harvest, at our setting-forth
and at our home-coming; there are gods of
flocks and herds, of vineyards and olive groves,
of rivers and of the sea. Poetry has peopled
the air with them, and given to Aphrodite a
team of sparrows, and to Hera a team of
peacocks, and to grey-eyed Athene an owl.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>Indeed, it is strange, so familiar and frequent
are they in our thoughts, that we should ever
question their existence; yet the moment we
seek for any tangible evidence of their presence
in the world we are at fault, and the more we
consider them the more shadowy and elusive
they become. The whole notion of divinity
is constantly changing in our minds, adapting
itself to new conditions of life, varying its
form as our knowledge becomes deeper; but
always becoming more spiritual, less tangible,
until it seems to be nothing but that wandering
breath which quickens all things into life.</p>

<p class='c000'>"At first we imagined the gods as the incarnation
of some natural force, like Aphrodite,
the foam-born, whom all living creatures obey;
or Demeter, the Earth-mother, who produces
all the fruits and harvests, and the grass and
flowers of the field. Stripped of the mystery
and beauty with which the poets have clothed
them, these are but the conditions of man's
life, his begetting and sustenance; we must
seek behind them for that idea of the supreme
reason, who is not only the cause but the end
of all things, not only the source of existence
but the principle from which spring our
notions of truth, of wisdom, of justice, and
all those ideals which reconcile us to life and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>bid us hope in the ultimate realisation of the
good. It is not sufficient for us to find a
cause from which existence is derived, for
even if that were laid bare to us we could
not find in it our ultimate satisfaction, unless
it conformed to the idea of divinity, which,
as Socrates and Euripides have agreed, is
exclusive of all elements of evil. Is it possible
to have this knowledge? There are two
insuperable difficulties.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The first is in the nature of man's knowledge,
which is not constant or common, but
variable and peculiar to each individual. Each
man is the measure of all things. To him,
things are what they seem; truth, what he
thinks true; justice, what he thinks just; good,
what he thinks good. Coldness or heat, light
or darkness, colour, sound, smell, touch, taste,
are all equally matters of opinion. There is
no truth external to the individual. The
second difficulty is that even if all men had a
fixed and common standard of truth, we can
find no evidence of the action of any divinity
in the world, no evidence of a supreme reason
dominating all things. The world seems to
obey certain blind and unreasonable laws; but
the life of man, the life of all things, outside
the mere routine of tides and seasons, seems
<span class='pageno' id='Page_77'>77</span>to be subject only to chance: and whether we
live or die, our fate is the result of an accident.
We are merely the idle foam upon the surface
of the waves of being; an accident, and not
the reason of the waves. Perhaps the whole
reason of life is unconcerned with us; having
a different aim to what we imagine, we ourselves
being only the dust of a sculptor's
workshop, the superfluous marble which he
chips off from the hidden image of his desire.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is certain, that if there be a God he is
careless of the fate of man. For, if there were
a God, since he must be just and good, we
should find the prayers of the good man
answered, and evil would be punished in the
world. As it is the evil men prosper, and
the good gain no reward; evil and good, what
are they but our points of view? It is for
this reason that we doubt the existence of
any but a mechanical cause for the universe;
because we have had no experience of good
triumphing in the external world. Diagoras
of Melos, being taken into the Temple of
Poseidon and shown the offerings dedicated
there as memorials of answered prayers and
in fulfilment of vows, looked at them with
tears: 'They reckon those who were saved,'
he said; 'they forget those who perished.'
<span class='pageno' id='Page_78'>78</span>Yes; one is more touched by the thought of
what was not hung in the temple, than by the
sight of what was. We think of the smallness
of the temple, and of the largeness of the sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Let us state our position with clearness.
We are not concerned with the existence of
the gods, but with our knowledge of their
existence. It would be equally foolish in us
to deny, as to affirm, their existence. There
may be a supreme reason acting upon the
world, whose ends we cannot understand,
whose action we cannot comprehend. It may
be that the world exists for some other purpose
than for the realisation of our own dreams.
Perhaps we are only the superfluities, the
parings of ivory, the winnowed husks from
the threshing, by-products in the creation of
something more perfect; and perhaps the
confused and obscure sense of an ideal, which
works in us and is at once our desire and our
despair, is a dim consciousness of the growth
of this beauty, a desire and a despair of being
one with it. But, if we could escape for a
moment from the tyranny of our own selves, the
illusion of our own momentary existence, we
might learn to rejoice in the knowledge, that
beauty exists, if not in us, at least somewhere
in the world. If that knowledge were ever
<span class='pageno' id='Page_79'>79</span>present with us, I think that we might be
content. Content even to suffer, to realise
that everything that ever lived has died for
an idea, that all life is a martyrdom; but,
alas! we have not even this knowledge. Our
life is a dream of shadows. Our knowledge
is but a focus of wandering ideas, burning a
moment in a white heat, ere they pass again,
diffused widely, into the unknown.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The sense of divinity, which moves in us,
may be but a hope born of this trouble and
perplexity, a desire that at some future time
the fragments of our being shall be collected
again and fashioned into a whole. We cry
out that we need not be wasted, to drift
forever as dust, blind, dumb, and inarticulate,
yet with a dim consciousness of a life stirring
beyond us and alien to us. Let us share in
it. Let us have a share in the world's sunlight
and the sweet air. We have personified this
hope, and given it an extended significance
which seems to breathe and move in all things.
Each individual finds his justification in God;
and it follows that his God must be merciful,
just, and good; but, at the same time, the
notions of justice and good are entirely peculiar
to the individual. God is thus a realisation of
self, a self who triumphs and will be justified,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>even through his misery. The very practice
of virtue is an accusation against the gods,
an affirmation that if the good perish then
God is evil.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am a maker of myths, one who fashions
out of perishable things a thought which,
through its informing truth, exists independently
of time. I think of man as of one who
is blind, dumb, and without hands. Sitting
alone in this physical darkness a thought
comes to him of what his life might have been
if he had been born whole; and he imagines
himself as a man with hands, a voice, and
sight, creating a whole world out of his
pleasure. This other man, who moves like a
creature of light through the dim passages
of his mind, becomes, as it were another self;
but through his greater power, a being of joy
living eternally, a strong, triumphant, beautiful
figure; and consequently external from,
and different to, the man. And the blind,
dumb, handless man, bowing his head in
the darkness, says: 'It is God.'</p>

<p class='c000'>"For the gods which we have imagined are
immortal men, and man a mortal God. They
differ from us in nothing but the gladness and
eternity of their actions. They move delightfully
on the wings of the wind; through the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>great tumult of waters their feet are swift and
sure; their voices have a music that is like the
fierce motion of dancing, yellow flames. God
is simply our own selves, made whole, and
removed from the devouring years. God is
our weakness searching after strength, our
blindness, thirsting after light; our desire
seeking for a voice, and we worship him. We
worship him because he is ourselves; but we
seek him, always, as if conscious of our own
weakness and worthlessness, beyond ourselves,
in the external world, Our God is hidden in
the deeps of the sea; in the shadows of the
forests; in that blue heaven beyond the stars.
He is very subtile, moving on stealthy feet,
through unknown ways. We seek him, but
we find him not. He is swifter than we are,
and when we pursue him he flies away into
the darkness; and when we cry out that we
have lost him he comes close to us again,
filling our hearts with a silent sweetness. So
it is ever with us; when we seek to clasp him
he eludes us; but in the silence of night we
imagine that he is not very far away and that
a little thing would suffice to allure him to us,
to reveal him to sight.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Once in a country of hills and valleys lived
a shepherd who called to the nymph Echo, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>she answered him from her cave in the hillside
with his own voice. Then he girded himself,
and taking a staff in his hand set out to seek
her; and coming to the place whence she had
answered him, he called again, and she replied
from a higher peak. When he had called from
the next peak he was answered from the valley
and descended into its deep forests; and men
saw him no more, for he died there, and the
beasts devoured him.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We also die ere we have found the voice
which calls to us from the mountains; but it
ever lures us forward, calling sometimes from
a cave quite close to us, and again from a
distant peak. We also die, and our ears hear
it no longer; but our children will hear and
follow it gladly up the steep glens of the
windy hills."</p>

<p class='c000'>As Protagoras finished, he dropped the roll
of parchment beside him, and motioned the
slave to bring him some wine. Lysis rose
from his couch and attempted to crown him,
when the loud voice of Pythodorus broke in
upon the general conversation.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What is this that you are applauding?" he
said; "are you men of Athens or foreigners
fond only of subtile words? I, for one, shall
not praise or consent to what has been said
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>by Protagoras here to-night. What has he
done but cloak his impiety in smooth phrases
and suave periods? Are you willing, through
his soft persuasion, to deny that the gods
inhabit the wide skies and the hidden regions
of the bright sea?"</p>

<p class='c000'>A silence fell upon the company. One or
two shifted uneasily upon their couches. It
was fairly well known that Pythodorus had
some personal grudge against Protagoras; but
no one had suspected that he would take this
opportunity of revenge.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You are mistaken, Pythodorus," said
Euripides. "Protagoras has only discussed
the question of whether we can have any
knowledge of the gods. He carefully disclaimed
any intention of denying their
existence."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is clear to me, Euripides, that Protagoras
has denied them," answered Pythodorus.
"He claims that if we do not know a thing,
the thing does not exist. But I shall not
argue the question here; I shall lay it before
the proper judges. An offence against the
gods is a crime in which the whole city is
implicated, and which they must cleanse from
themselves. I would have you believe that
I am not moved by any personal feeling
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>against Protagoras, but only by a desire that
the whole people should not have to expiate,
in suffering, the crime of one man. All the
misfortunes of Athens have arisen from the
spirit of irreverent sophistry which is eating
her away; and people now seem to think
that they may say anything, provided that it
be well said."</p>

<p class='c000'>He spoke in a raucous voice, trying to
contain his passion, but with an exultant fire
in his eyes. Socrates sat up on his couch and
rubbed his leg.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Pythodorus, you are as bad a listener as
I am. I can never understand these long
speeches. They act like a charm, and I
always fall asleep in the middle of them; but
before I fell asleep to-night I heard what
Protagoras said as to his main position, and I
think that he was laughing at us. He spoke
only in a cautious vein of paradox. While
he was pretending one thing, he was proving
the opposite. You must not take him very
seriously."</p>

<p class='c000'>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Were you awake all the time, Pythodorus?"
said Socrates.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Of course. I was listening most attentively."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>"Then you will remember that Protagoras
said that the gods were not to be found in
the external world, but in the hearts of men.
We cannot know them, as we know a tree,
but we can feel them by us. He seems to
hold that we cannot know anything except
what we have drawn out of ourselves."</p>

<p class='c000'>Socrates was attempting to lead the conversation
back into quieter channels, but
Pythodorus rose.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I shall leave you. It is not for me to
judge whether Protagoras is right or wrong,"
he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some of the guests left with him, through
fear, and the rest were dismayed. Protagoras,
who had not said a word in answer to Pythodorus,
leaned back on his couch and spoke.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Of course, Pythodorus will accuse me,"
he said; "and I shall be condemned. He is
powerful, and in the present condition of
things can do as he likes. But it would be a
shame if we allowed the malice of one person
to interrupt our discussion. Let us sit talking
until dawn, and then I shall prepare to leave
Athens. I expected that he would do me
what injury he could. Shall we have some
more wine, Euripides? It is probably our
last feast together."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>"I am afraid it is," said Euripides. "Yes;
let us have some wine. I blame myself for
what has happened; but I never expected this."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It would have happened to-morrow if
not to-day," answered Protagoras. "Do not
blame yourself, Euripides. There are, I think,
few persons in this room, who will escape
from the reaction which is developing in
Athens. Socrates, of course, will survive it.
He follows the traditions of religion, but, at
the same time, he differs from them. What
was that curious paradox you put forward
about my teaching, Socrates?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"It was no paradox, Protagoras, but sober,
earnest truth. You will never persuade me
that your intention was to deny the existence
of the gods."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well, then, let us discuss it. Only our
friends are here now. And to-morrow I shall
be beyond the reach of malice. Can we know
the gods, Socrates?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"You confuse the two things, because
Pythodorus did. Philip has not deserted us.
He is sitting there half drunk. Will you
argue with him? If with me, answer what
I ask. You denied, did you not, that we can
find any trace of the action of the gods in
this world?"</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>"Yes."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And did you not affirm that the gods
exist, if they exist at all, in a manner
peculiar to themselves."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Without denying the existence of the
gods, then, you affirm that we cannot know
them because we cannot find any trace of
their action in the life of man?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"That is what I said," answered Protagoras.</p>

<p class='c000'>"And you also said that, man being the
measure of all things, truth is what he thinks
true; good, what he thinks good. There is no
truth external to the individual. Did you not?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, Socrates; but I am afraid you are
giving a sense to my words which they were
not intended to convey."</p>

<p class='c000'>"That is not my object. I wish merely to
examine your thought. You incline to cloak
it in myths, but you should learn to send
truth from you clean and naked, as a trainer
sends an athlete into the palæstra. If I offend
you, Protagoras, you must forgive me; but I
cannot follow an argument which is not
direct. Do your words contain my meaning?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, Socrates."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Then you deny all truth except what a
man draws out of himself?"</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>"Yes."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And a man should not say it is cold. He
should say I am cold?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes; all external things are only what we
imagine them to be."</p>

<p class='c000'>"The same, of course, holds good with
regard to truth, virtue, and justice; these
things are equally external to the individual.
I think that you have said this before, Protagoras,
have you not?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes," said Protagoras.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well, then, let us leave that part of the
argument for the present," said Socrates. "We
shall return to it later, as every one agrees
to it. I wish to ask you another series of
questions. If you wished to learn the art of
making plays, would you go to a cobbler or
to Euripides? To Euripides. Very well!
But if you wished to learn the art of making
shoes, would you go to a cobbler, or to a
playwright?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"To a cobbler, of course!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"You would choose one skilful rather than
a beginner; and in politics, also, you would
choose an experienced man, in preference to
one who had no experience, and in art you
would take the finest artist as your master.
Would you not?"</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>"Of course."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And the same with pastry-cooks, with
tillers of the soil and vine-dressers; you would
choose the person most experienced?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes."</p>

<p class='c000'>"All this I have learnt from what you said
at the beginning of your discourse. If you
wished to learn the arts of politics or of
cobbling you would go to a politician or to a
cobbler; but if you wished to learn the art of
being virtuous, would you go to a vicious or
to a virtuous man?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"To a virtuous man."</p>

<p class='c000'>"But why, Protagoras? Is not the test of
truth in yourself and not in others?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Then you know the truth, and you recognise
it when you meet with it?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes."</p>

<p class='c000'>"But then the truth lies also outside of
ourselves. Goodness, wisdom, and other
excellent things are external to us, and we
can only draw them out of ourselves? Have
you not said that God is a projection of self?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"A stronger self, Socrates."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Then you recognise a standard of excellence
beyond man, and this standard of
excellence he draws out of himself; and that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>only is true which a man draws out of himself;
but at the same time you recognise in others
the art of cobbling and of politics."</p>

<p class='c000'>"These things are only conventional," said
Protagoras.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Why, Protagoras? What is the difference
between going as an apprentice to a good
cobbler and going as an apprentice to a good
man?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Because cobbling is an art that any one
may learn, but virtue is different."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Is virtue different from doing good?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"No."</p>

<p class='c000'>"A virtuous person will seek the good; he
recognises goodness by his own standard?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes."</p>

<p class='c000'>"He is the measure of truth, and he chooses
a teacher who will show him a fitting wisdom,
as he will choose a cobbler who will make
him a fitting shoe?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Socrates, I frankly admit that I am tired
of your cobbler."</p>

<p class='c000'>"But is virtue doing things well or ill?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And the individual judges whether the
thing is well or ill done?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"You are still cobbling, Socrates."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Surely, Protagoras, if truth is drawn
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>entirely out of the individual, he will know
virtue better than he will know a shoe. I do
not want you to say that I am forcing your
words into a construction that they will not
bear. Your arguments suggest others to me.
I am cobbling, you say, point out the patches!
You say that there is no truth external to the
individual; that if a man feels hot, it is hot;
that justice is what he thinks just, that he
cannot know external things. Surely, then,
his whole standard of truth is himself. And
if he fashion a God out of his inner consciousness,
surely God exists more truly than a
tree or a shoe exists."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Socrates, my words may bear this expansion.
You hold, then, that we may have
knowledge of their existence. I am not averse
to this belief; but to me a God is simply a
self, a self freed from our conditions of life.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Let us not say that Socrates or Protagoras
has triumphed. We have simply got a little
closer to the truth."</p>

<p class='c000'>"God may exist for the individual, Socrates;
in the individual consciousness. But the truth
lies beyond us. Man's image of a tree is true,
because a tree is."</p>

<p class='c000'>"The colour, the shape, the texture, are
not," replied Socrates; "except as the man
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>sees them. Philip was right in saying that
if we know one thing we know all others.
Philip, wake up!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Socrates, what mischief are you up to now
that Pythodorus is gone," said Philip. "You
talk too much. Protagoras said simply that
a monkey imagines God as a monkey, while
a peacock imagines him as a peacock."</p>

<p class='c000'>"O Philip, what a fool you are! Does
a foolish man imagine a foolish God? Does
a blind man imagine a blind God?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Of course not."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Then, listen, Philip! Does Pythodorus
imagine a God who is a nuisance to his
friends?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"No."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Very well, then, some standard exists
which is external to the individual, but which
he only knows through his inner consciousness.
The oracle at Delphi was right when it said:
'Know thyself. For the more a man knows
himself, the more he knows God.'"</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is dawn," said Lysis.</p>

<p class='c000'>"O Socrates, you are the most unbridled
and insatiable of all the sophists," said Protagoras,
laughing. "You have laid a trap for
me."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Why do you accuse me of laying a trap
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>for you? We are not arguing with the sole
desire of scoring a point against each other.
I do not lay traps for you, as if I were a
hunter of men; but I lay traps for truth, being
a hunter of truth, and having no other reason
for existence but to chase and follow after it
wherever it may be hidden."</p>

<p class='c000'>"We have no more time, Socrates," said
Protagoras. "Tell me your own opinion of
the gods and of the aim of life."</p>

<p class='c000'>"What can I say to you," said Socrates,
"beyond what a prophetess taught me? For
she said that in our voyage through the world
we are being reminded constantly of a previous
existence, and that when we are brought face
to face with beauty or with virtue or with
truth, in short wherever we are moved to
admiration as in contemplating a work of art
like the chryselephantine Zeus at Olympia, it
is the memory stirring in us of the place from
which we came; and, further, she asked me
if I had never felt an inexplicable sadness
mingling with all beauty, as if beauty itself
were inseparable from sorrow. 'Yes, Diotima,'
I answered, 'in the presence of beauty we are
all sufferers.' 'Then Socrates,' she said, 'let
me tell you that this feeling of sadness in the
presence of beauty is in reality a sense of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>exile; for however deeply we may drink of
Lethe, the soul will retain some broken
memories of the garden of the gods. When
we meet with beauty in the world it is but a
mutilated fragment of the divine beauty, but
however small or slight it may be in itself, it is
sufficient to call up into memory the divine
beauty; and it is then that the sense of exile
rushes in upon us like a wave and we weep
and suffer anguish, and can neither tear ourselves
away from the beautiful thing, nor be
content with it; but all our being thirsts after
the more perfect beauty. But let me warn
you, Socrates, that however much you may be
tortured in the presence of the beauty that
lies scattered through the world, it is your
business to collect each tiny fragment; and if
it be a few bars of music you must build it
into a song; if it be a mere tangle of coloured
skeins you must weave it into a garment; if it
be fragments of gold and ivory you must
make them into a statue; if it be beautiful
colours you must make them into a picture,
or beautiful words then into a poem; and all
this time you will suffer and be tortured with
desire for the more perfect beauty. But,
until you have gathered together the broken
fragments which are in the world you will not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>return into the garden of the gods.' 'Then
the gods exist?' I enquired. 'Certainly the
gods exist,' answered Diotima; 'but they
exist in a manner peculiar to themselves.'
She would say nothing more, but when I
questioned her smiled wisely and was silent."</p>

<p class='c000'>Hermogenes met Lysis by the porch of the
King Archon near the house of Callias.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Have you heard the news, Hermogenes,"
said Lysis, "I have just been with Euripides.
Protagoras is drowned. Within sight of
Sicily a storm came up and drove the boat on
the rocks. The sailors saved themselves by
swimming; but Protagoras, who could not
swim, sat on the prow of the boat. They saw
him from the beach sitting calmly until the
boat split in two. The waves reached out for
him, and in a little time his bruised and
battered body was cast up at their feet. As
they reached for it it was snatched away by
another wave. And so the sea played with
him like a cat playing with a mouse. Then
he was flung ashore. His face was bloody
but smiling."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It was a judgment of the gods," said
Hermogenes.</p>

<p class='c000'>"So everybody says."</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>The house of Serenus lay about four miles
from Gades, in a country of vines and olives.
It was built a little below the ridge of a hill,
which sheltered it from the north-east winds,
and fronted south-west, overlooking the
Atlantic and a long stretch of the coast-line
with its innumerable headlands and curving
bays. From the windows in the upper storey
Serenus could see this wide expanse of waters,
never completely the same, but always restless
and troubled, with caprice in sunlight,
or anger in storms; or, turning to another
aspect, the hills and valleys of his own estate;
a land of cornfields, vineyards, and olive-yards,
pleasantly diversified by slopes of green upland
pasture, and beyond them the wild beauty of
mountains with frosty summits and well-timbered
flanks. The house was surrounded
by a garden planted with myrtles and plane-trees,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>with alleys screened from the fierce heat
of summer by dense boughs of ilex, curving
tortuously in labyrinthine windings, or running
perfectly straight until they ended in an
arch, the frame, as it were, for some picture
of land or sea. The grass by the paths was
kept mown, but here and there, among
thickets of myrtle, grew rank, harbouring the
green lizards, who slipped out every now and
then to bask in the sunlight on the marble
steps, or on the pedestals of the statues of
Priapus and the woodland gods.</p>

<p class='c000'>Beyond the garden, Ceres crowded abundantly
into every corner. Half a mile away, at
the foot of the hill, its red-tiled roofs just showing
above the terraced vines, was the house of
the farm-bailiff; thither came the tall daughters
of the peasantry bringing the offerings of their
mothers in plaited baskets, pale honey in its
wax, young leverets, and capons luscious for
cooking. In the yard all the crowd of
common poultry wandered about, while the
tower echoed with the joy of pigeons, answered
from the neighbouring trees by the cooing of
ring-doves and white turtles. Thither also,
on feast-days, or to the humble marriage of
one of their companions, all the slaves of the
estate were bidden, the huntsmen with the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>herds; and Serenus would sit among them,
eating the same fare and drinking the same
wine, while much wood burnt to the festal
Lares.</p>

<p class='c000'>As he grew older, Serenus had come to
love the tranquil life at his country-house,
the soft, warm air blowing from off the sea,
the noise of rippling water and of wind
stirring in the leaves. He had arrived at
that period of life when a man is content to
stand aside and become a spectator. In the
last few years his hold upon the management
of his large properties had been gradually
relaxed, and he had come to rely more and
more upon one or two trusted slaves and
freedmen; but at irregular intervals he would
make a journey to all his possessions in Spain,
visiting Bilbilis where he had iron-fields, and
bred horses; a delightful country it was, "high
Bilbilis enriched by arms and horses; Caunus
austere with snows, and the broken hills of
Vadevero, the sweet grove of Botrodus which
Pomona loves."</p>

<p class='c000'>His interests extended in many directions:
he was concerned in the mines of Spain; he
owned a fleet of ships which sailed to Rome,
and beyond, even to Corinth; his agents
followed the army to buy slaves; and he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>lent money, though principally for political
purposes, to the young officials, half civil
and half military, for whom the government
of a province was a means to fortune and
imperial favour at Rome. At first this villa
in the country had been used only in the
hottest months of the year, and the site
chosen because there seemed always to be
some mysterious currents of air flowing
about it from the cool hills toward the sea,
and because innumerable springs had their
sources in the rocks; but gradually there
woke in him that living interest in rural
pleasures and labours, which was always an
instinct with the Romans even during their
worst decadence; he became glad at any time
to visit it, and drink in its mild delicious air
in that peaceable garden overlooking the
mysterious sea.</p>

<p class='c000'>The need for leisure grew upon him, and
he added a wing to the originally modest
house in order that he might transport thither
his libraries from Gades; he transported also
his Greek statues, his tables of citrus wood and
ivory, his myrrhine vases; he built a roofed
colonnade, pierced with windows on both
sides, and with movable shutters, so that
the weather-side might be closed at will; he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>devised rooms to catch all the winter sun,
and rooms shaded by vines which were cool
through the hottest days; he built sumptuous
baths, and a new triclinium, and new guest-chambers;
by every window, colonnade, and
walk he planted roses and violets to sweeten
the air; and he stocked his fish ponds with
rare fish for the table.</p>

<p class='c000'>But in spite of the later more sumptuous
buildings, and new elegances which he brought
with him, he did not forget that he had come
into the country in order to be with the elementary
conditions of life. He felt very near
to this earth which furnished him with everything
he ate. From the time the wheat was
sown until it came upon his table in little
loaves it had been handled by none except
his own slaves. At the vintage, he would
go out to the wine-press and gaze on the
wine-jars, as they were carried into the
cellar to stand with the older jars, in which
mellowed the fragrance of earlier autumns;
and day after day, in a broad-brimmed hat
and worn military cloak, he would walk
down to the farm and listen to the pleasant,
familiar noises, the clamour of the geese, the
lambs calling to their full mothers, the cooing
of the pigeons in the tower, the murmur of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>the bees about the populous hives; and the
children hung shyly about him, for he generally
brought them some nuts, and would
tempt the wild-eyed things toward him,
holding the nuts in his open hand, as a man
might tempt a bird with crumbs.</p>

<p class='c000'>He was still fond of hunting, fond of the
deep shadow of the woods, the stealthy alertness,
the cunning and science of wood-craft,
he felt that he could best repel the advance
of age by such exercises; but even in the
woods perhaps his chief pleasure was in a kind
of meditation, a conversation with himself,
induced by that silence which the sport imposed;
and, when the boars had been finally
driven into the nets and slain, he would sit
beside them, eating bread which he dipped in
wine, and writing on his tablets, in a small,
fine hand, the thoughts suggested by the
day's journey. It seemed to him that the
physical exercise, the free play of the air on
face and limbs, awakened an equal vivacity
and alertness in the mind; and that Minerva,
no less than Diana, was a goddess of the
deep solitudes. Two Roman officers from
Gades, Sulpicianus Rufus and Marcus Licinius
were his usual hunting companions.</p>

<p class='c000'>After his morning exercise, Serenus was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>used to take a cold bath, and then sleep for
a little while during the heat of the day.
Coming from his bath one morning, a little
before noon, he found his two friends in the hall.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Seneca is dead;" was the news they
brought him.</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, in one of the libraries, he learned
the details.</p>

<p class='c000'>Rufus had been a friend of Seneca, and
the story had come direct to him. The three
friends were strangely moved. Marcus and
Serenus listened in silence as Rufus described
the scene at the villa.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He asked for his will, that he might make
some bequests to his friends; but this was
forbidden. Turning then, to his wife and
the two friends who were dining with him,
he said that since Nero had murdered his
mother and brother it was not to be expected
that he might spare the instructor of his
youth. Paulina desired to die with him, and
the physician opened the veins of both. But
Seneca's blood would not flow, and he drank
poison; finally, he was carried to a warm
bath, and died. Paulina's wounds were bound
up, by command of Nero, and she still lives."</p>

<p class='c000'>"She is more to be pitied," said Serenus.
"What others died?"</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>Rufus gave their names.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Lucan, too!" exclaimed Serenus. "Does
Gallio still live?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have not heard of his death; but it is
impossible that he would escape."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes," said Serenus; "Seneca's family
is annihilated. It is like the working of
Nemesis. We have been the spectators of
one of Fate's tragedies, which are so rare.
It is complete, large, full of irony; and
Seneca's own words, 'the murderer of his
mother and brother would not spare the instructor
of his youth!' One thinks of them
less as Seneca's own words, than as the
sardonic comment of a later historian. They
are too apt."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You were not one of Seneca's friends,"
said Rufus.</p>

<p class='c000'>"No," said Serenus; "Nero is the direct
result of Seneca's teachings. So brutal a
voluptuary could hardly issue from any but
a Stoic school. It is at once raw, crude, and
narrow; it coarsens our natural appetites
instead of refining them. For Stoicism the
human emotions, love and pity, are but weaknesses,
which it denies and attempts to stifle.
It is very far from the secret of human
sympathy. Nero as a young man had many
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>excellent qualities, which an artistic and delicate
training might have developed into fine accomplishments:
he might have learned the art of
life; and instead he has learned only rhetoric,
the sort of rhetoric that vitiates every action,
and makes our emotions the subject for a
stage declamation, makes life a mere piece
of acting. Yet I must not forget, Rufus,
that Seneca was your friend. Perhaps he
was better than his philosophy; but I have
never been able to forgive him either for his
adulation of Claudius during his life, or his
satire upon him after his death."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Seneca was un-Roman," said Marcus.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Why do you say that?" enquired Serenus.</p>

<p class='c000'>"All his ideals were un-Roman," answered
Marcus. "His notions of the brotherhood
and natural equality of man, his unpractical
nature and sentimentalism, his absolute lack
of a grasp upon realities and their significance,
his condemnation of war and of slavery. His
life was composed almost entirely of noble
maxims, and of trivial actions."</p>

<p class='c000'>"He died well," said Rufus tersely.</p>

<p class='c000'>"A final gesture," said Marcus, rubbing
his arm. "We Romans are superbly self-conscious.
We die in public, with appropriate
speeches."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>"What you think peculiar to Seneca,
his sentimentalism and idealism, are really
parts of the present spirit, and common to
all schools," answered Serenus. "Rome has
broken down the ancient national barriers, and
given to all peoples the notion of humanity
as a whole. It is from this cause that the
idea of a world-state has its origin. But
Rome governs by force; other nations are
tributary to her; she has enslaved them;
they are the base upon which she has raised
her grandeur. They feel that they are unjustly
treated. We have created new conditions.
We have shut them off from their
legitimate activities by refusing to allow them
to govern themselves, or to make war upon
their neighbours; so that the whole life of
the Empire is centralised in Rome, and the
provinces have become stagnant. And from
these new conditions has been born a new
spirit. Life seems too full of suffering; the
poor and the oppressed are many, and because
they are so many they are becoming articulate.
They would build a new heaven and a new
earth. I learnt of this first at Corinth."</p>

<p class='c000'>"The whole corruption of the world comes
from the Greeks and the Jews," said Rufus
contemptuously. "What is the use of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>clamouring against life? It is a problem that
we must each solve for ourselves, and no theory
will help us. If society were wrong, if Rome
were wrong, if force were wrong, we should
not be sitting here in comparative comfort. To
talk of the tyranny of the State is nonsense;
individual liberty is what each man wins for
himself, and the State merely offers the most
convenient mechanism by which it may be
gained. As an example we have the growth
of a large class of rich freedmen. The disease,
from which we are suffering at present, is
simply a form of sentimentality. What is
morality? What is justice? What is good?
The only answer is: 'That which law orders.'"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Do you believe in the gods, Rufus?"
enquired Marcus, with amusement.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I follow the customs of my forefathers,"
answered Rufus bluntly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The gods are dead," said Marcus, still
rubbing his arm.</p>

<p class='c000'>"They are not dead," answered Serenus
gently; "but they have changed their names.
The people will always worship the same
Divinity, the Giver of rain and good crops and
victory in battle, and health in life, and peace
toward death."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I never understood Seneca's philosophy;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>but I loved the man," said Rufus. "The
greater part of him was weakness, but he had
strength. He was a good man of business,
Serenus."</p>

<p class='c000'>"He was a clever man, with admirable
opportunities," answered Serenus. "I am an
Epicurean, and Seneca's teaching is not mine.
Yet, in some of its details his teaching is also
Epicurean. With him, philosophy was less
an affair of the mind than of the imagination,
and of good taste; it is always the artist, the
orator, who is teaching, and his eloquence is
never quite persuasive, because the artist is
never quite persuaded. He belongs to no
school, he is an eclectic; and he seeks rather to
inculcate the practice of virtue than to show
what virtue is. He neither asks nor answers
a question. The vices and weaknesses which
he condemned in others he had found in himself;
his was a subjective, a poetic, a romantic
mind. And it was precisely for this reason
that his disciples loved him, because of that
emotional and many coloured nature, which
saw virtue, the most austere virtue, ever as a
god, and found it unattainable."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, that is true," said Rufus.</p>

<p class='c000'>"But did Seneca believe in the gods, and
in the immortality of the soul?" enquired
Marcus.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>Serenus smiled.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes," he answered; "Seneca spent his
whole life in seeking for the truth, but the
truth for which he sought was one which
should be agreeable to his own nature. A
divinity was necessary to his well-being. He
speaks of a loving God, of a God who orders
the world aright and whose will we should obey
without a murmur; and in consequence his
hatred for the Epicureans was great. He
could not forgive us for showing the gods
serene and untroubled in their abode, into
which penetrates no whisper of mortal anguish;
and for saying that no voice of prayer troubles
their endless pleasure, and that without tears
or anger they gaze at once upon our sorrow
and our sin, and are heedless of the hands
uplifted in supplication from every corner of
the earth. Yes; God is necessary to a Stoic.
But we Epicureans have called upon the gods
and they have not answered us; we have
sought them throughout the world and have
not found them; neither are they in the seas
nor in the skies; we have not seen them
destroy the wicked nor protect the innocent;
we think that they are not interested in our
humble affairs; they are neither our masters
nor our creators, but belong to the same order
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>of things as we do, though of a finer and less
perishable nature: if, indeed, they exist at
all."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Stoicism is a hatred of humanity," said
Marcus; "perhaps Epicureanism is a love of
it. Rufus, do you not think the Epicureans
are clever? They do not deny the existence
of gods; but they make their gods of such
a divinely intangible substance that doubt
becomes in itself almost an act of worship.
It is as if they feared to profane the sanctuary
with human feet soiled by the dust of travail."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have given you my opinion of philosophy
and philosophers," said Rufus. "Once a man
begins to think of the difference between right
and wrong he is lost, morally and mentally. I
studied philosophy in order to learn how to
write despatches; and in the short course I
took, I acquired enough knowledge of the subject
to know that good and evil belong to the
category of reflex actions, they are spasmodic
movements over which we have no control.
Do I praise my legionaries because they are
brave? I do, as a matter of fact. It makes
an admirable prelude to the imposition of
another task. Seneca imagined that men
could be disciplined into virtue. It was
a great mistake, because discipline is not
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>applicable to the individual, it is only
applicable to a crowd. It is easy to fill a
regiment with courage; but it is impossible
to make one man brave."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You do not think that it is possible to
form individual habits?" said Serenus.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, of course," answered Rufus; "it is
possible to accustom a man to sleep on a hard
bed, to deny himself wine or flesh, even in
some degree to control his temper. But an
action is good or bad, only in so far as it is
a reflex action."</p>

<p class='c000'>"What you say is very curious," said
Serenus quickly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"In fact Rufus is a complete philosopher,"
said Marcus, laughing. "I should like to drink
a little wine."</p>

<p class='c000'>Serenus struck a sounding-bowl of silver,
and a Greek boy entered.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Wine," said Serenus, and the boy left
them. "Rufus, you have heard of a sect of
Jews called Christians; do you know their
belief?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"No," said Rufus contemptuously; "I only
know that it is against the Jewish religion
to pay tribute. I believe that they have no
religion; they are contemptuous of all known
gods; they will eat no flesh which has been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>offered in the temples; and they loathe the
whole human race: a feeling which, I think,
is reciprocated. The Christians seem to be
one of the numerous sects given over to the
practice of a depraved and fantastic superstition.
The East is full of such monstrous
cults."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Greek boy set wine before them, threw
a few grains of incense on a brazier, and
departed softly. Marcus drank a white Greek
wine; Rufus poured himself out a large bowl
of Falernian.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I take mine with a great deal of water,"
said Serenus; "because my stomach is weak.
Alas! sometimes I think it is my stomach
which has taught me the virtue of moderation.
I have heard a man, who was a Christian,
speak in almost the identical words of Seneca.
The cardinal point of his doctrine was not
the Stoic apathy, but the recommendation of
sympathy, that is the difference between them.
Here and there he uses the same phrases and
illustrations as Seneca. It shows how widespread
the new spirit is."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Seneca's teaching did not interest me,"
answered Rufus. "It was the man I loved.
Though it is long since saw him, I cannot
believe that he was contaminated by Judaism."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>Serenus felt a curious desire to disburden
himself.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I went a great deal among the Christians
once," he said softly.</p>

<p class='c000'>The two men looked at him for a moment,
with that curious expression of distrust which
men adopt when another confesses to some
social indiscretion.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It was nearly nine years ago, and perhaps
my nature resembled Seneca's then; my
philosophy was an affair of the heart. I was
seeking for a beauty that is not of this world.
It was at Corinth. I met a man named
Paul."</p>

<p class='c000'>"All things are possible at Corinth," said
Rufus. "Tell us your story, Serenus."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And then we shall stay to dinner," said
Marcus, as he finished his wine.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is a long story," said Serenus, smiling.
"I have written it on a roll, and shall read it
to you. Let us go out into the garden; it is
cool and pleasant there now. Lysis will bring
you what you want. Do you remember telling
me, Rufus, that Seneca drew you to him
by his weakness? Paul drew me to him by
his strength."</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c000'>Passing out of the library through the atrium
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>the friends crossed a small courtyard enclosed
on three sides, and turning sharp to the left
began to climb the slope which sheltered the
house. The walk was shaded by a thick hedge
of ilex, and there were tall, slim cypresses at
irregular intervals. Leaving the path, they
crossed a plot of grass, starry with little flowers,
and, passing through a thicket of myrtles, came
presently to a semicircular stone seat shaded
by beeches which stood, eastward, a little way
behind it. Falling water tinkled like little
silver bells somewhere close to them; and the
leaves made a pleasant whispering noise. Lysis
covered the seat with rugs, and left them. The
seat faced westward, overlooking the olive-yards
which the winds flushed to silver; and
the friends had a magnificent view of the
Atlantic. In the declining light the distant
promontories, blue and lemon, seemed to jut
out into a bath of liquid colours, as if suspended
in the vague; and the horizon was indeterminate.
A fleet of fishing-boats, some miles
from the shore, seemed like small, brown moths
with motionless wings that had settled upon
a flat screen of transparent blue gauze, and
about them the light gleamed and flickered
upon innumerable little dancing waves. It
was all blue and green, but so pale and silent
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>as to seem a mirage. Marcus, lounging easily
upon the wide seat, looked over the prospect
with unconscious enjoyment. Rufus sat with
his chin in his hands.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I love to sit here on tranquil evenings,"
said Serenus; "and listen for the cry of the
halcyon, or the heavy plunge of a dolphin,
drifting up through the delicious air from
the bay."</p>

<p class='c000'>He unrolled his manuscript, and presently
began to read, in a smooth, low voice:--</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c000'>"When Venus rose out of the foam and
froth of Ocean it was upon the prow of a
Phœnician trader, that carried her into every
part of the known world; and when her
worship fell away and her votaries became few,
the cult of Venus Pandemos still flourished
at Corinth, and her temples there were served
by a thousand priestesses. There she loves to
have her abiding place, where she can look
out upon two seas, and watch the sail-winged
ships bringing her tribute from distant lands;
she is the lure, beckoning them over the pathless
sea. The port Cenchrea is surrounded by
green hills and pine forests, and through the
stone-pines at dawn the sun sends his first
level rays, so that their trunks show black
<span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>against the gold. The streets are infested
with traders of all nations; Jews and Syrians
swarm there; child courtesans with delicate
and innocent faces pluck strangers by the
sleeve and smile; the quays and streets are
crowded with the booths of merchants and
moneychangers, whose gay awnings striped
red or yellow glare vividly in the sunlight;
and doves are everywhere, fluttering about
the streets, fanning the air with a soft pulse
of wings, alighting upon awnings and architraves
to preen their feathers, running swiftly
among the passengers on their pink feet and
cooing, cooing softly like the young girls who
touch men on the sleeve, the very gentle,
insinuating whisper of Aphrodite.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I arrived at Corinth in the beginning of
December, and remember well the gaiety,
animation, and bustle of the scene as I
watched it from the steps of the temple; for
a long time I fed my sight upon that busy,
amorous, wholly pleasure-loving crowd, until,
at last, the red and yellow awnings so hot
and vivid even in the winter sunlight, the
perpetual passing to and fro of men and
women, the continual change and motion of
colours, and the humming noise, all combined
in a curious hypnotic effect upon my nerves.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>What had seemed the very epitome of life
became a mere stage-scene, and then again
nothing but the dance of motes in a sunbeam.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It irritated me and then tired me. I turned
from the Temple of Venus and sought that of
Apollo, where I rested a little time in peace.
Then I went to the house of my agent, with
whom I was to lodge until I had taken a
house for my own use. The man was kindly,
but tactless; his tedious anxiety to please
distracted and irritated me, he was so much
at my service that I could find no possible use
for him. I said I wished to bathe, and my
host insisted on coming with me. It was
amusing to watch his air of importance as he
conducted me through the crowded ways, for
he was a notable person in the city, and every
other man we met greeted us; as we paused
a moment before a funeral procession I heard
a voice saying: 'That is Serenus, a cousin of
Acte's Serenus,' and once again I felt the
intolerable stare of curious eyes, that dropped
obsequiously when I met them. After my
bath, my host led me to the Prefect's palace,
for I had letters to Gallio, and then at last he
left me. Gallio received me charmingly; his
manners are those of a man who has known
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>and forgotten everything. He begged me to
dine, and to stay with him until I had found
a house; but I excused myself on the score of
business and fatigue. He smiled, answered
that he would always be glad of my company,
and I left him.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Once again in the streets, that vivid and
passionate life appealed to me with a new
sympathy; I read beneath the superficial
gaiety and glitter, the human tragedy, the
flight of pleasures and the irrevocable advance
of death; women passed me in soft murmuring
draperies, smiled at me languorously and
passed on leaving the air tainted with Eastern
perfumes. I noticed that even as they smiled
their eyes were wistful. The delicate winter
sunset began. I called a boy to me and asked
him to guide me to the house of Caius, whom
I wished to see personally on some business
connected with the outfit of my ship. He
led me to a house in the Jews' quarter and I
tapped at the door. A freedwoman admitted
me, looked at me with surprise, and was just
going to speak but changed her mind and led
me toward the doorway of a room whence
came a sound of some one reading. Light
fell through the doorway as she drew back
the curtain; and she motioned me to enter;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>but I drew back in astonishment, for a voice
was reading aloud these words: 'Though I
speak with the tongues of men and of angels,
and have not love, I am become sounding
brass or a tinkling cymbal. And though I
have prophecy, and understand all mysteries,
and all knowledge; and though I have all
faith so that I could remove mountains, and
have not love, I am nothing. And if I give
away in food all my goods, and though I give
my body to be burned, and have not love, it
profiteth me nothing.'</p>

<p class='c000'>"The grave voice ceased, for the servant had
beckoned the reader, and presently Caius came
toward me. I gave him my orders with
reference to the sails and tackling of my
ship, and spoke of other ships of mine which
he had refitted for me; and then asked him
what author he had been reading. For a
moment he hesitated, and then answered that
he had been reading to some friends a letter
by Paul, an apostle of Christ. I enquired if
I might look a little more closely at it as I
had been interested in what I heard; and
after hesitating again for a moment he brought
it me. The scroll half opened in my hands
and I read:--</p>

<p class='c000'>"For behold your calling, brethren, how
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>that not many wise after the flesh, not many
mighty, not many noble, are called, but God
chose the foolish things of the world, that
he might put to shame them that are wise;
and God chose the weak things of the world,
that he might put to shame the things that
are strong; and the base things of the world,
and the things that are despised, did God
choose, yea, and the things that are not,
that he might bring to nought the things
that are.' Mine eyes followed the words as
the roll opened: 'Howbeit we speak wisdom
among the perfect; yet a wisdom not of this
world, nor of the rulers of this world, which
are coming to nought; but we speak God's
wisdom in a mystery, even the wisdom that
hath been hidden, which God foreordained
before the worlds unto our glory; which
none of the rulers of this world knoweth;
for had they known it they would not have
crucified the Lord of glory.' My sight ran
heedlessly over the next few lines until they
came to these words: 'For I think, God
hath set forth us the apostles last of all, as
men doomed to death; for we are made a
spectacle unto the world, and to angels, and
to men. We are fools for Christ's sake, but
ye are wise in Christ; we are weak, but ye
<span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>are strong; ye have glory but we have dishonour.
Even unto this present hour we
both hunger, and thirst, and are naked, and
are buffeted, and have no certain dwelling-place;
and we toil, working with our own
hands; being reviled, we bless; being persecuted,
we endure; being defamed, we entreat;
we are made as the filth of the world, the
off-scouring of things, even until now....
What will ye, shall I come unto you with a
rod, or in love, and a spirit of meekness?'</p>

<p class='c000'>"I rolled up the scroll, and gave it back
to Caius, saying that I should like to read
it all, but that at the moment I had not
the time; and I suggested that he should
lend it to me. He shook his head, murmuring
that it was not his property, that it was
only deposited in his house for safe keeping,
the convenience of those who wished
to consult it; but he offered to let me see
it, in his house, at any time that I might
wish. I said that perhaps I might come
again, and went out into the street. I do not
think that I had any intention of coming again;
but as the women passed me in the moonlit
streets, and the beggar children held out their
supplicating hands, I seemed to hear the
words: 'If I give away in food all my goods,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>and though I give my body to be burned
and have not love, it profiteth me nothing.'</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes; I felt it in those streets, where
little girls, still children and innocent, aped
with a diabolic mimicry the manners and
allurements of the women who followed me,
followed me with a soft, rippling noise of
draperies and odour of cosmetics, like shadows,
like ghosts. In the city of the goddess of
pleasure, I seemed to learn, for the first
time, the secret of pain. But beyond and
above that sympathy with this drifting helpless
mass that is humanity, I felt a curious
desire to learn more of the personality of the
writer who could write: 'If any man considereth
himself wise among you, let him
become a fool that he may be wise, and
threaten to come among his disputing disciples
with a rod.' His humility seemed to overpass
the bounds of pride, his words were whips,
his contempt for argument and disputation
burned with a superhuman energy. He
seemed to say: 'These are but words, empty
sounds. I teach you the truth, accept it
humbly; have I not suffered for it, and will
you, who have but enjoyed it in peace and
plenty, attempt to alter it?'</p>

<p class='c000'>"I came back to my lodgings, and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>woman who had followed me turned away
with a sigh.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The next ten days I spent on business;
and I went a great deal to the Prefect's
palace where the conversation of Gallio and
his friends charmed and delighted me. Gallio
saw the world and the Empire drifting toward
a complete breakdown. Civilisation, according
to him, filled man with desires which he
can never gratify; it tended to accentuate
the difference between the poor and the rich,
and the whole question resolved itself for him
into a question of politics. The Roman
stock was perishing, and its place was being
taken by a horde of servile races. The people
were only being kept in check by a system of
doles, and amused with pageants. The burden
of taxation was becoming insufferable.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It may last our time," he said with a
smile; "but the disease is ineradicable. A
revolution, or a series of great wars, might
carry us forward for a time. We are suffering
from a mortal sickness, growth, which inevitably
brings decay."</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c000'>It had been arranged that one of my ships
should follow three weeks after my departure
from Gades; and on my arrival at lazy Naples,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>I had intended to wait for it, consequently I
had remained there for three weeks and a few
days, and the other ship not coming by that
time I continued my voyage to Brundusium.
There again I waited, anxious for news, and
at last reluctantly put out to sea without it.
It arrived at Corinth fourteen days after I did,
and brought me a letter from my nephew, but
none from my wife. In an agony of doubt
I opened it, and read that my wife and child
had died of a fever which had afflicted them
a few days after my departure. First my son
had died, a boy little more than three years
old; and my wife, after lingering some time,
followed him. I had moved into my own
house, and was alone. Sending a messenger
to my agent I bade him see to all things;
and told him that I wished to be left undisturbed.
The words of the Master came to
me:</p>

<div class='lg-container-b'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>"Nam iam non domus accipiet te læta neque uxor</div>
      <div class='line'>Optima, nec dulces occurrent oscula nati</div>
      <div class='line'>Præripere, et tacita pectus dulcedine tangent."</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c000'>It seemed to me that the peace and tranquillity
of my home, the sole aim of my life,
having been shrivelled up like unsubstantial
things, vanished like dreams, life had thrown
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>me, too, aside and left me stranded, a piece
of wreckage, upon this alien shore. For
many days I sat alone in my sumptuous
house, and the statues of the gods, blithe
Greek things, which I had bought to furnish
it, and for transhipment to the new home
which I had meant to make at Rome, smiled
at my unavailing tears. Then one morning
my slaves admitted a young boy to my
presence.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Caius bids me tell you that Paul is in
Corinth," he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I shall go," I answered.</p>

<p class='c000'>After he had left me, I repented. Why
should I choose to frequent the Jews and
miracle-mongers of Corinth, who swarmed there
on the way to Rome from every part of the
East, astrologers, and sellers of love-potions,
poisoners, and go-betweens? But the words
rose up in my mind: "God chose the foolish
things of the world, that he might put to
shame them that are wise:" and I wished to
be ashamed. In my weakness and grief my
hands went forth and groped in the darkness,
seeking the hands of those who had also
suffered, seeking for the little familiar, common-place
things, that twine themselves round
our being and are the mainstays of life. My
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>abandonment of life in my grief had been so
complete, that but for the message which
came to me from Caius, I might have drifted
towards self-destruction, merely because of
the sullen inertia, which followed after the
force of the blow had been spent. Philosophy,
religion, discipline, every vain convention
which we imagine may buttress our will in
moments of great spiritual weakness, fell away
from me like garments, and the only thing
remaining was a sense of human sympathy,
a craving for human consolation.</p>

<p class='c000'>Our master, Epicurus, was a lover of children;
he knew, no one better, their delicate and
insinuating ways, the strange unreal world in
which they play, their unconsciousness of time;
and he seems to have taken them as patterns and
exemplars of the life of pleasure, unsuspicious
of the future, and forgetful of the past, but living
always with a vivid intensity, in that little,
shut-in pleasure-house of the senses, the
moment. As I thought of my child, I remembered
all his caresses, the soft touch of
his flower-like hands upon my face, and the
grave eyes that seemed to keep a wisdom
older than the world; and beside that image
in my dreams stooped another, Drusilla, her
hands guiding him to me, she whose whole
<span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>life was like some attenuated fragrance, difficult
of apprehension, but inexpressibly sweet,
her quiet brows with neat bands of hair
smoothed against the cool flesh; and the love
that grew between us, first for what she
revealed to me, and then for what she hid.
When I thought of these two brief, beautiful
creatures, I seemed to see in them the true
fragility of life, as if it were no more than
wind in the stops of a flute or sweet vibration
from the strings of a lyre, aerial, elusive, never
to be wholly imprisoned in any one form, but
wandering, vocal, through the whole of creation,
illuminating it to one exquisite moment,
like light upon hill and sea, and then vanishing,
fleeing away into darkness, never to be
exactly repeated.</p>

<p class='c000'>So to me, sitting apart and outwardly
unmoved, there came that fierce hunger for
things departed, that blind, bitter struggle
against the unalterable conditions of life.</p>

<p class='c000'>I hesitated, and delayed to set out on my
adventure until well on into the night At
last I went. A fresh wind was blowing from
the north-west, it stung my face and eyes,
and I saw that snow lay lightly upon the
summit of Acrocorinth, silvery in the moonlight.
As I passed into the Jews' quarter I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>began to meet little knots and groups of
people talking with excited gestures, and I
heard rumours of brawls and quarrels; but
I reached the house of Caius without incident.
The same boy who had brought me the
message admitted me. He had fine clear-cut
features, distinctive of no particular race,
though with evidence of Roman blood somewhere.
Caius was the son of a freedman I
gathered later, and this boy was the eldest
of his two children, the other being a girl.
The boy told me that the meeting was over,
but that Caius was with Paul and his travelling
companions in an upper chamber; he
led the way and I followed. I felt cold and
suspicious, but curious. The boy drew back
the curtain, whispered my name, and I
went into the warmly-lighted room. Seated
by the brazier was a thick-set, crook-backed
man, ugly and mean, with a small head,
much too small for his shoulders, a sallow
skin and thick beard. As I entered he lifted
his face; the eyebrows met above the beaky
nose, and he regarded me for a moment in
complete silence. The eyes were piercing,
as though full of smouldering fires. They
seemed to explore the most secret recesses
of my soul; then to grow kinder, as if
recognising something in it.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_131'>131</span>"Peace be with you, and light, and understanding,"
he said; and as he spoke there
seemed to me a hesitation and an embarrassment
in his manner. I murmured something
in reply, at which, perhaps, a slight
smile broke about his lips, and he turned
away. Caius brought me the manuscript
which I had looked at, gave me a chair in
a warm corner by a lamp, and went back
to the others. I began to read. Four men,
besides Caius, and a woman were gathered
at a table by Paul. One of the men was
holding a pen. Then the voice of Paul
broke the silence.</p>

<p class='c000'>"For the law of the spirit of life in Christ
Jesus hath made me free from the law of
sin and death. For what the law could
not do in that it was weak through the flesh,
God sending his own Son in the likeness
of sinful flesh, and for sin, condemned sin
in the flesh. That the ordinance of the law
might be fulfilled in us, who walk not after
the flesh, but after the spirit. For they
that are after the flesh do mind the things
of the flesh; but they that are after the
spirit, the things of the spirit. For the mind
of the flesh is death; but the mind of the
spirit is life and peace.... And if Christ
<span class='pageno' id='Page_132'>132</span>is in you, the body is dead because of sin,
but the spirit is life because of righteousness."</p>

<p class='c000'>Holding the manuscript on my knees, I
listened. The passion of the speaker seized
and held me; he was like one so full of
speech as to be inarticulate, he seemed to
falter through many phrases until he found
the right one; he would go on blindly,
following the mere impulse of his mind,
without thought or reason, until at last, as
with pain, words came to him that seemed
to touch the heart, to illuminate hidden
places, and what had gone before was transfused
and crystallised by it into a kind of
rude and imperfect unity. Sometimes after
one of these magnificent utterances, he would
give forth phrase after phrase, that glowed
with the heat of his own certainty. "Who
shall separate us from the love of Christ?
shall tribulation, or anguish, or persecution,
or famine, or nakedness, or peril, or the
sword?" He dealt with speech as one
dealing with iron in the fire, hammering out
the words. "Nay, in all these things we are
more than conquerors through him that loved
us. For I am persuaded that neither death
nor life, nor angels, nor principalities, nor
things present, nor things to come, nor
<span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>powers, nor height, nor depth, nor any other
creature, shall be able to separate us from
the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus,
our Lord."</p>

<p class='c000'>He was persuaded. Seeing that they had
forgotten me, I lifted my eyes and studied
him as he spoke. I saw that his health was
bad; the carriage of his head seemed epileptic,
but bodily health was nothing to him;
he seemed worn with travel and hunger,
misfortune and persecution, yet the fire of
his speech showed the strength of his conviction;
even as, in his words, he seemed to
thrust the world away from him for the sake
of an idea, so, for the sake of an idea he had
thrust away his infirmities, and pursued his
way heedless of obstacles. "Shall the thing
formed say to him that formed it. Why
didst thou make me thus? Or, hath not
the potter a right over the clay, from the
same lump to make one part a vessel unto
honour, and another unto dishonour?"</p>

<p class='c000'>Sometimes Paul moved a little, with
nervous half-conscious movements; or while
speaking he would stretch his large toil-worn
hands over the brazier where the light gleaming
through the fingers made them seem more
distorted. As a rule he spoke slowly, but
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>when he became dominated by his thought the
words hurried, more and more quickly, until
the writer paused, perplexed, and, not without
a slight gesture of impatience followed
by a swifter smile as if of encouragement,
Paul would repeat himself; sometimes losing
the thread of his discourse. Indeed, from
what I learned of his life, it seemed that it
was his fate to be thwarted and hindered
by material restrictions, of health, of liberty,
of speech. No vessel was capable of sustaining
the flame that burned in him. I
could not understand all that he said, as
I knew nothing of what was behind; but
here and there his words burnt into my
brain.</p>

<p class='c000'>The man who had been writing stopped,
stretched his cramped fingers; and Paul
motioned another to his place: "Abhor that
which is evil, cleave to that which is good.
In love of the brethren be tenderly affectioned
one to another.... patient in tribulation,
continuing steadfastly in prayer, communicating
to the necessities of the saints, given to
hospitality. Bless them that persecute you;
bless, and curse not. Rejoice with them that
rejoice; weep with them that weep.... Be
not wise in your own conceits. Render unto
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>no man evil for evil.... Let every soul be
in subjection to the higher powers: for there
is no power but of God; and the powers
that be are ordained of God." I had sat
listening to these words of conviction until
I felt numbed, yet I was not satisfied.</p>

<p class='c000'>Paul also seemed to weary for a minute.
The word "love" that seemed to contain all
their mystical creed fell again from his lips:
"Thou shalt love thy neighbour as thyself;
Love worketh no ill to his neighbour; Love
therefore is the fulfilment of the law; and
this knowing the season, that now it is high
time for you to awake out of sleep."</p>

<p class='c000'>He ceased, rose and walked to the window,
drew back the curtain, and leaned out as if
to cool his head. The sky was grey with
dawn. From the streets below came drunken
voices of men and women, singing ribald songs;
and presently I heard the tramp of the armed
guard. For a moment Paul leaned there.</p>

<p class='c000'>"The night is far spent," he said, "and the
day is at hand; therefore let us cast off the
works of darkness and put on the armour of
light. Let us walk honestly, as in the day;
not in revelling and drunkenness, not in
chambering and wantonness, not in strife and
jealousy. But put ye on the Lord Jesus
<span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>Christ, and make not provision for the flesh
to fulfil the lusts thereof."</p>

<p class='c000'>He ceased, drew the curtain to again, and
came towards me. Through his incredible
ugliness there shone a majesty of power,
fascinating, enchanting, wooing me with its
strength and flame-like intensity. His hands
were cold from the ledge of the window, and
as they took mine a thrill ran through me.
The other men looked at us quietly, as if
they were conscious of some crisis, and of
some antagonism between us. Paul looked at
the manuscript upon my knees, and smiled.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What are my words to you?" he asked.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have also thought of these things," I
answered him.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes; it is not the thinking of them
that is strange, but what do they mean to
you? What does our law mean to you? What
does our mystery mean to you? Nothing.
You are given over to vain imaginations,
the conceits of the mind. You have no
humility, no faith. Your great possessions
have turned your mind. Until the blow fell
upon you, you had imagined that you were
secure through life. You have put your
trust in perishable things, and they have
fallen through your fingers like water, like
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>dry sand. What have you left sacred in the
world? Your wisdom has made a desert
about you, a desert where there is no God.
What have you to hope?"</p>

<p class='c000'>It was as if he mocked me, pitied me,
understood me. He made me cold toward
him; and at the same time my sorrow flooded
me.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What is my trouble to you? I can bear
it alone," I said harshly. "The things which
you have written I have read in our own
philosophers."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You have found nothing else in me which
was not in them?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Nothing."</p>

<p class='c000'>A gloom spread over his face, the light
which had illuminated it died out, leaving
only the smouldering fires of his eyes, which
burned dimly. He dropped my hands. The
others turned away their eyes and shifted
uneasily.</p>

<p class='c000'>"There is he in whose name I speak.
The love of Christ constrained me."</p>

<p class='c000'>I sat frowning, without comprehension.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is not yet time," he continued sadly.
"One must have patience, exceeding patience.
You do not understand what we teach concerning
Christ, who is the Son of God. Yet
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>you came to us willingly; you, a Roman,
came and took the hand of a Jew, whose
touch, to your fellows, is contamination; and,
in my pride I said: Lo! I have triumphed
over the wisdom of the Gentile. It is through
God's grace only that I am called to be an
apostle to men. It is through his grace
alone that you will be saved; for you will
come again. Tell me that you will come
again."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I shall come again," I said simply; the
curious anxiety of his words troubled me
vaguely. I felt a profound pity for this man,
to whom even a stranger was a brother. I
rose and took my cloak; as I passed out each
gave me a salutation, the salutation of peace.</p>

<p class='c000'>Outside it was dawn. The lupanars were
giving up their dead, some sailors and devotees
of the great goddess were already congregating
in the wine-shops. Muffled as I was in my
great coarse cloak they suspected me of being
one of the Roman soldiers, and none spoke to
me or offered me insult. I did not heed
them but passed along the quays, looking at
Acrocorinth towering like Eryx, that other
home of the sea-born and lure for sailors, into
the infinite blue of a cloudless sky. Wreaths
of vapour cloaked its lower reaches, and it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>seemed like a great dome suspended in the air.
On the other side laughed the wide sea in
multitudinous ripples of light. It all seemed
to reflect some childish half-conscious gaiety
of my soul. My sorrow still lay there, but
comforted with human sympathy, and the
two mystical gifts of the Christians, peace
and love.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c000'>It was only after I had escaped from the
enchantment of his presence that I was able
to understand the aims and ambitions of Paul,
as he showed them in the letter which he had
dictated that night, and which was to be
copied and sent to all the communities that
had come together in Greece, Asia and Italy.
His aim was principally to abolish the restrictions
which hampered conversion into his
faith, rites of the Jews, circumcision, the use
of certain meats which they had considered
unclean, and the huge body of formulæ and
observances, which had grown and developed
out of casuistry and the old Hebrew law; but
beyond and above that he wished them to
propitiate the civil power. When he spoke
of the abolition of the law he meant those
rites and ceremonies which seemed a profanation
of, a bartering with, the divinity. He
<span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>felt that his mission was not to the Jews
alone, but to all the nations of the world.
In this he was opposed by the more rigid
Christians at Jerusalem, who held that circumcision
was necessary, and that only a
Jew could be saved. One of the most rigid
adherents of this narrower sect was a brother
of Christ, who seemed to pass his whole life
in the Temple, praying and fasting.</p>

<p class='c000'>Paul was often bitter against this sect. Yet
it was out of that same kind of formalism
that he himself had sprung; and he seldom
lost traces of it, except in a few isolated
moments, when love and indignation burnt
him up. I went among these Christians
again and again; and each time became more
fascinated by their hidden, gentle lives. A
very intimate tie bound Caius to Paul, for
Paul had initiated him into their mysteries,
which were, I imagine, the same as in other
religions, a purification and a mystic meal.
Caius was a man of considerable power, but
of immense reserve, from whom I learnt very
little. Paul was a fanatic, impatient of the
opposition to his teaching at Jerusalem.
Sometimes in anger he would satirise his
opponents and the rite of circumcision with
a bitter and sardonic humour. He was honey
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>to those he loved, gall to those who withstood
him.</p>

<p class='c000'>The community in Corinth having fallen
back during his absence into a moral laxity,
almost excusable considering their environment,
he withdrew them from all social intercourse
with their fellow-citizens. They obeyed
because they loved, but more, because they
feared him. Before his conversion he had
persecuted the Christians to turn them from
their faith; afterwards he persecuted them to
keep them in it. I learned the story of his
conversion. It had its origin in the death of
one called Stephen, who had been accused
before the Jewish Collegium of blasphemy; a
frivolous pretext for the punishment of one's
opponents which had obtained everywhere but
in Rome.</p>

<p class='c000'>As you know, the law of the Empire is that
no one shall be punished with death except by
a Roman court, and only when he has been
convicted of specified crimes; for the spirit of
Roman usage has always been, in the words
of Tiberius, that the injuries of the gods are
the gods' affair. Stephen, after an argument
with his accusers, suddenly cried out with a
loud voice: "Behold, I see the heavens opened,
and the Son of Man standing at the right hand
<span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>of God." With one accord his exasperated
enemies stripped off their cloaks and laid them
at the feet of Paul, who took charge of them;
and they stoned Stephen, Paul consenting to
his death.</p>

<p class='c000'>Even at the time, perhaps, standing aside
and taking no part in the murder, Paul's
conscience may have reproved him. In any
case the incident assumed, afterwards, an enormous
importance for him. He could not speak
of it without emotion. Perhaps also he feared
that he might be accused to the Roman
authorities for his part in the riot. His
mind became abnormally excited.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some days afterwards he set out for
Damascus to bring up some more Christians
to Jerusalem, to be tried by the same barbarous
assembly. Suddenly at noon he saw a blinding
light, and he fell to the ground. A voice called
to him out of the sky. According to some
accounts the voice uttered a phrase from
Euripides: it is hard for thee to kick against
the goads. The phrase had passed into current
use. However strange it may seem that a
voice from heaven should have uttered these
words, it is perfectly natural that Paul should
have heard them; he must have heard them
before, many times.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>But what goads were meant? The pricks
of conscience, perhaps, for his share in the
murder of Stephen; some secret remorse,
against which he had steeled his heart, in the
hope that time and use would cure it. Such
was the conversion of Paul. His nature had
suffered no change from it; he had merely
found a new aim for his life, and the same zeal,
which he had used in his persecution of the
Christians, he now asserted in their cause. To
himself this incident of his conversion seemed
unnatural, miraculous; but to us it is simple,
and easily explained, being merely a repetition
of Stephen's vision. As I have already written,
he was of delicate health; some nervous, constitutional
weakness affected him; epilepsy,
perhaps, or something akin to it. His
accounts of what happened varied; for he
seemed to have told the story in different ways
to different people. In one account, those
who were with him heard the voice, but did
not see the light; and in another version they
saw the light, but did not hear the voice.
Paul himself had not known Christ in the
flesh. He knew little of him, except that he
had been born, had gathered about him a
group of disciples, had preached, and had died
on the cross.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>His mind therefore could fashion no clear
image in the vision. He could only see a light
and hear familiar words. He himself always
treated this vision of the risen Master as
distinct from the visions which had been manifested
to the other disciples, as a purely spiritual
manifestation: "and lastly," he said, "He
appeared to me as to an abortion." What
does he mean by this phrase? Does it mean
that Paul's spiritual birth was effected by
violence, prematurely; that it was precipitated
by the murder of Stephen? Is it remorse for
Stephen's death that forces him to apply this
hideous epithet to himself; or is it a reference
to the lack of definite, sensible impressions; or
to the fact of the lateness of his conversion; or
merely a scornful reference to his own physical
deformities? He was accustomed to speak
with a bitter mockery of his infirmities, yet,
it seemed also, with a little pride. He mentioned
in the letter, which Caius showed me,
that he had prayed for the removal of some
physical disability, but the prayer had not been
granted. The fragility of his vision was even
used by his opponents, the small sect practising
poverty at Jerusalem, among whom was the
brother of their Master, as a ground for denying
his mission. One is almost tempted to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>agree with them. The evidence is vague, the
accounts vary. We may wonder into what
form these floating legends will crystallise, if
the community endures and increases; if they
will ever form a complete unity, like the
myths of Orpheus and Dionysos.</p>

<p class='c000'>There are some who imagine that Christianity
is but one of the many features of the new
social movement, which was Gallio's opinion;
but I cannot think so, for the reason that the
Christians believe in the rapidly approaching
end of the world. They believe that their
Master, who was crucified, will return, even
before his own generation has passed away,
to judge the world. It is the cardinal point
of their teaching. Any definite social reconstruction
is consequently outside their aims;
but the organisation of their communities, in
so far as it can be called an organisation,
resembles rather closely our popular funerary
societies, which have always been looked upon
with suspicion by the authorities.</p>

<p class='c000'>Paul's exhortation to his community "to
be in subjection to the higher powers," was
written with the intention of guarding against
any outbreak which might prejudice "the
powers that be, and are ordained of God,"
against the communities, who seek only to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_146'>146</span>be left to the peace of their quiet lives and
the practice of their cult. They are a little
humble folk for the most part, except where
there are Jews among them, and then arises
the question of the tribute money; whether it
be lawful to pay it? That is the only cause
which may put them in conflict with the
authorities.</p>

<p class='c000'>But there is a graver danger to the friends
of Paul. They are for the most part humble
artisans, followers of the lowest trades,
mendicants, and cheap hawkers; despised by
all classes, they are at once despised, hated,
and feared, by the class immediately above
them, with whom they must necessarily enter
into competition where the dividing line is
faint, or barely drawn at all. Beside this
natural jealousy of an alien competition, there
is the sense of distrust which the secrecy of
their lives breeds in the minds of the citizens.
People invariably suspect a man who leads a
retired life, either of some shameful practices,
or of a guilty past. Yet suspicion and persecution
do not suffice to turn this little community
out of the way they have chosen.
After the day is over, they meet together, as
one family, in some dimly-lit room, and greet
each other with peace and love. It is time
<span class='pageno' id='Page_147'>147</span>to awake out of sleep, they say; the hour
approaches, the Lord cometh. That is their
whole life, they have no active part in the
great revolutionary social movement of slaves
and freedom, they sit with folded hands,
patiently, awaiting the coming of their Lord,
who shall judge the world, and end it.</p>

<p class='c000'>Moving among them, taking part almost
in their daily life, a life removed and hidden
from the world, how could I blame them?
Their credulity even seemed sacred to me,
it was so fragile a thing, of such delicate and
exquisite growth, a desire which has lain always
close to the heart of man. For me, beyond
the flaming walls of the world sit the deathless
gods in their quiet seats, peace flooding their
hearts; and no sound of mortal anguish ascends
to them, but they sit ever in their halls shining
with silver and glittering with gold, and the
lovely lyre makes an immortal music about
them, and wine gladdens the feast, and the
rhythmic motion of the dancing choirs; but
for these poor artisans of Corinth the god is
a companion by the way, they love to speak
of him under homely words, he is the vine-dresser,
the grafter of olives, the sower; he
carries into their sordid lives the peace of
wide skies and tranquil waters, he is the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_148'>148</span>shepherd who tends his flock and leads them
into pleasant pastures. Yes, behind Paul, the
man of fire, whose life was an odyssey, full
of arduous endeavour and storm, was another
figure, a figure of singular beauty, before
whom even the fire of Paul's ardour flickered
and was tamed, the Christ whom man had
crucified, and who had redeemed man from
sin and death. They seemed to have fashioned
him out of their own weary lives, their blood
and tears; he had pity on their suffering, and
suffered for them; he had mercy on their sin,
and took it upon himself, they could bear all
for his sake who had borne all for theirs; he
had revealed to them sympathy and love.</p>

<p class='c000'>The great central points of their teaching
meant nothing to me. The promise for me
was void; but the conditions of the promise,
there was the charm. Sometimes I think
that if I could have put away from me all my
philosophical preoccupations, I would willingly
have left everything I possessed, for the sake
of that peace, that security, that trust in something
outside ourselves, which is infinitely
wise, infinitely merciful, infinitely loving. But
faith, belief, is not an act of volition, it is
the spiritual nature; it is the possession of
children and of simple folk.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_149'>149</span>To those who have looked into the nature
of things, who with Epicurus see man as only
the momentary grouping together of a substance
essentially transient and mutable, life
itself is the end, a life of fine appreciations,
retirement, and leisure, and a death that has
no awakening. We, too, love our neighbour;
we, too, have charity toward the bruised and
broken lives about us; we, too, recommend all
men to hide their lives, to be moderate, to
abhor that which is evil and cling to that
which is good. We are Christians without
Christ.</p>

<p class='c000'>My own grief was still with me, but a
serene and hopeless resignation had taken the
place of despair. The memory of Drusilla
and my child haunted my waking moments,
and daily thoughts, like vain phantoms
escaped for a brief moment from the shadowy
realm of fabled Proserpina. The past was
part of my consciousness; as it is, I suppose
of every man. I began again to frequent
the Prefect's palace, to listen to his mellow
wisdom which he cloaked in laughing phrase,
as we passed easily from one subject to another
without exhausting any. Seneca's raillery was
dull beside his brother's; Seneca laughed at
women and the comedy of manners, to Gallio
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>nothing was sacred, not even his philosophic
brother. At the same time I still continued
to frequent the house of Caius, and the
society of the Christians. It placed me in an
anomalous position, and one day Gallio said
laughingly that a friend had accused me of
assisting at the secret rites and orgies of the
Christians, but that he had replied I was
more likely to frequent the pretty daughter of
Caius. Then I remembered the daughter of
Caius, a young girl of extraordinary beauty,
with a perverse expression, blonde hair, and
eyes like a cat, that watched every movement
with a stealthy curiosity. She seemed lonely
and out of place in that house of austere
gravity.</p>

<p class='c000'>"She is already famous as a beauty," said
Gallio.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I go there on business," I said with a
smile, and willing to let him believe what
he would; and, I added, after a moment's
thought: "she is charming."</p>

<p class='c000'>Gallio laughed, and then changed his tone
quickly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I do not advise you to frequent that
quarter of our delightful town," he said. "It
is the haunt of the worst characters in Corinth,
thieves, sorcerers, and charlatans inhabit it.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_151'>151</span>Even the house of Caius is not free from
suspicion; it is said that some of our ladies go
there for love-potions, or for other purposes."</p>

<p class='c000'>I was thinking, and did not reply to the
innuendo. Gallio watched me for a moment
curiously, in silence. I did not speak.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have bought a little masterpiece, a painting
by Parrhasios of the triumph of Bacchus.
Come and see it; it only arrived from
Athens this morning."</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c000'>The next time I visited the house of Caius
I spoke to Paul of what Gallio's suspicions
were; a sullen glow filled his eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is no new thing," he said; "on every
side we are looked upon with suspicion and
distrust; we are poor, and live cheek by jowl
with the evil things of life, and therefore we
are also evil. The rich, and those in high
places trample upon us; yet we shall be
justified."</p>

<p class='c000'>Pride filled him.</p>

<p class='c000'>"In a little time you go away to Rome,
and I to Jerusalem to carry alms to the saints
there, whom the Jews persecute. We are
like two travellers, who have met together in
an inn, and spoken of their travels; but at
dawn they separate and go their several ways.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_152'>152</span>Shall we meet again? You are not one of us,
but perchance God will lead you to us. Be
humble; put away all vain imaginings of the
mind; love all things; suffer all things."</p>

<p class='c000'>He gazed at me sadly for a time.</p>

<p class='c000'>"If you would but close your eyes and put
out your hand trustfully, God would lead you
through the darkness. You are almost of us;
and yet you are not of us. There is a barrier
which you cannot pass: you cannot believe."</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, again, after a moment's pause.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You must not come here again."</p>

<p class='c000'>He rose and left me. The last time I
saw that small, bald head poised upon the
huge misshapen shoulder was when they were
framed in the doorway; then the curtain fell
and he had gone. I sat a little while, almost
sorrowful. Then a small, delicate hand was
slid into mine, and I heard a soft voice
whispering:</p>

<p class='c000'>"You are going away. Take me with you."</p>

<p class='c000'>It was the daughter of Caius, she clung
to me and gazed appealingly at me out of
her precocious eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Take me away with you," she repeated.
"I shall do anything for you; only take me
away, take me away. I cannot stay here.
It will kill me. They are so good and I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_153'>153</span>wicked; yes, I am very wicked. Some one
told me I was beautiful, and it pleased me.
I want to go with you. I am wicked. I
want people to see that I am beautiful...."</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c000'>Serenus began to roll up his manuscript.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is too dark to read the rest. But
now you know the Christians. What do you
think of them?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I think as I have always thought," said
Rufus; "all Jews are alike. They are the
enemies of the human race; their religion is
one of despair, and they do not hope to find
salvation in this world. The East is the home
of all credulity and superstition. Come to
dinner and let us arrange to do something
to-morrow. A hunt?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"What happened to the girl?" enquired
Marcus, stretching himself slowly.</p>

<p class='c000'>Serenus looked over the sea, toward the
fishing-boats, each of which showed a light.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Go down to the house, both of you, and
bathe. I shall follow presently. We shall dine
sumptuously to-night; and, yes, to-morrow we
shall hunt. It will pass the time."</p>

<p class='c000'>They left him. For a little while he sat
watching the lights out at sea, the spires of
mist wreathing above the olives, the dance
<span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>of fire-flies over the sloping lawn. He sat
motionless for some time; then he rose, and
sighed.</p>

<p class='c000'>"A little pleasure, and then darkness and
silence," he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>He began to walk slowly toward the house.
A path below him echoed with the sound of
footsteps and voices; looking through the low
branches he thought that he discovered in
the uncertain light the figure and features
of Paul, surrounded by the slaves of the
household.</p>

<p class='c006'>The fountain rose into the sunlight singing,
broke flowering a moment, and fell with a
chime of sweetness into the basin. Francis
looked at it with delight. The fine mist of
spray drifting from it made a little rainbow
in the court-yard.</p>

<p class='c000'>"All things praise the Lord," he said; "but
the voice of our sister the water is clearest.
She never ceases from her song through the
hot day, and all night she sings, from evening
until dawn."</p>

<p class='c000'>He gazed at it with the serene pleasure of
a child. In the shadow of the great curtain-wall
his companions walked up and down,
gesticulating, suddenly vivacious and then as
suddenly mute. A little group separated from
the others stood in the arch of the gateway
overlooking Rome. Cool, dark cypresses
showed here and there among the bell-towers
<span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>and fortifications; and over all the broken
lines of roof and belfry wandered the liquid
sunlight, diversifying the colours of the tiles
through a myriad gradations from dusky
copper to pale gold, and ending now and
again in a sudden angle of deep gloom.
Yet Francis saw nothing but the water rising
into the clear light.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Beautiful thou art, and humble, and chaste,
and very precious to us," he said. "Of all
God's creatures thou art the most perfect,
delighting in his service, praising him for
the light of the sun, and the sweet air, as I
praise him for thee, O sister water!"</p>

<p class='c000'>He dipped his hand into the basin, and
cool ripples were woven about his long,
thin fingers.</p>

<p class='c000'>"These also are God's creatures," he said;
"the shy fish who come and go mysteriously
among the stems of the lilies. They move
obscurely through the dim ways, and no man
wonders at them; yet none of Arthur's
knights were arrayed in such golden mail."</p>

<p class='c000'>And taking a piece of dry bread, which a
beggar had given him, he broke it into small
crumbs, and strewed them upon the surface of
the water; and the fish came out from between
the stems of the lilies, and nibbled at the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>crumbs as the ripples moved them; but the
crust of bread Francis ate himself, and having
eaten he drank a little water out of the palm
of his hand, and spoke again.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Little fish," he said, "those knights of
Arthur's court, who were mailed in glittering
armour, had each one his lady, whom he served
in all things; and no one of them meddled
with the lady of another, because as yet evil
had not entered into their hearts; but they
went through the world succouring the
afflicted, and the innocent, and the oppressed;
and doing all manner of wonderful deeds,
being valiant men and strong, for the glory
of God, and the great honour of the lady
whose livery they wore. And the ladies,
whom they served in all honourable ways,
were fair and pleasant to look upon, and
moreover they were well-clad, having each
her golden ornaments, and jewels, and
kerchiefs of lawn, and fine cloth of Ypres;
yea! having all things desirable about them,
soft raiment, and dainty food, and wide houses
full of tapestries of Arras, with a gallery for
the musicians. But because of the luxury of
their lives, and the folly which ever prompts
the soul of man to evil, they fell into sin, and
no virtue remained in them.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>"Little fish, I am a knight of God; and I
have chosen for my lady one beyond all mortal
women. She hath neither fine raiment, nor
gold, nor jewels; neither a covering for her
head, nor shoes for her feet; neither land nor
castles; nay! not so much as a shelter against
the ravening beasts; nor do her serving-men
bring her delicate meats in vessels of gold and
silver, nor do musicians play to her upon viols
or psalteries, nor hath she any treasure hidden
in the ground. She goeth from door to door,
begging her bread through every city of the
populous earth; and the porters drive her
from the gate with blows; and the children
mock her in the streets for being old, and
lean, and ill-favoured; and the dogs snarl at
her heels. Yet all these things she endures
patiently, nor complains that men revile her,
for God hath put much comfort in her heart.
I, also, little brother Francis, in my youth
reviled her; for it was then my pleasure to
live sumptuously, to wear rich apparel, and to
pass my days with music and feasting; but
when she revealed herself to me I was overcome
by her exceeding great beauty, and I
lamented that I had not followed after her all
my days. Alas! it is the wickedness of men
that shows her as a vile and despicable thing;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>for having nothing she possesses all things.
God hath clothed her with virtues more
precious than rubies; he hath given her the
wide earth and all the pleasant ways thereof
to be her home; he hath commanded the
beasts that they do her no hurt: nay! they are
serviceable to her and fawn about her feet; and
God himself ministers to her, feeding her as
he feeds the birds of the air and the fish of the
sea, and sweetening her food, so that if it be
but a dry crust it savours most excellently to
her, even as honey and manna in the mouth.
Such is the excellence of my Lady Poverty,
with whom I shall always keep faith in this
life. Little fish, God hath given you the cool
water to inhabit; and he hath clad you in
golden mail, delightful to the eyes of men;
and when all the birds and beasts and
creeping things entered into the Ark, he
preserved you in a safe refuge beneath the
tumult of the waters: yea! of all things,
which went not in with Noah, he preserved
you in your multitudes though all else perished.
Little fish, I praise the Lord for you, because
he hath made you beautiful, and shown you
infinite mercies."</p>

<p class='c000'>But the fish, having eaten all the crumbs,
swam back among the stems of the lilies,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_162'>162</span>and hung poised there in the shadowy waters,
with undulating motions, waving their delicate
fins, and opening and shutting their mouths.
Francis considered them for a moment.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Little fish," he said, "perchance it is the
way that you praise the Lord, being dumb
and without reason; but men, to whom God
hath given such excellent gifts as speech and
reason, have turned from him. I would that
they also might learn to praise him with
great simplicity and joy in their hearts."</p>

<p class='c000'>He looked toward the gateway through
which he saw the roofs and towers of Rome,
the city which had not accepted him, inhospitable,
gay, given over to the lusts of the flesh,
the desire of the eyes, hungering passionately
after the tangible but transient pleasures of
this delightful world; a new Jerusalem, as
stubborn and hard-hearted as the old, but,
like that, too, a chosen city of God, in which
he had elected to dwell and have his abiding
place. Tears suffused his face as he looked
at it lying there calm and golden in the
sunlight.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have not known how to draw them to
me," he said. "Surely they would have
followed after me if I had spoken to them
more joyfully. A little thing delights them,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_163'>163</span>and they will flock to see a dancer, a juggler,
a jester! We must become the jesters of
God, amusing the hearts of men and leading
them toward spiritual joys."</p>

<p class='c000'>A bell struck, and was answered from all
the towers of Rome, until the air pulsed with
vibrations as if with a multitude of beating
wings. Francis moved slowly away toward the
new buildings of the Lateran. Those of his
companions who were pacing up and down in
the cool shadow of the wall suddenly stopped
and pointed to him.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Look! Look!" they cried.</p>

<p class='c000'>Some play of the wind carrying the fine
drifting mist over the isolated figure had
clothed him for a moment in a glory of radiant
colours. The sound of the bell still trembling
in the air, and the sudden iridescence of spray
in the sunlight, was to them a revelation.
Hearing their voices raised Francis went
toward them.</p>

<p class='c000'>"What is it, my brothers?" he asked of
them.</p>

<p class='c000'>They received him almost with adoration.</p>

<p class='c000'>"We saw you troubled, and in thought,"
answered Brother Egidio; "and then, suddenly,
as the bells ceased, we saw a glory shine about
you, and heard a great beating of wings."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_164'>164</span>But Francis remembering the doubts which
had afflicted him a moment before, cast himself
at the feet of Brother Egidio.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I command you, in the name of holy
obedience, that when I return you say to me:
Francis, son of Pietro Bernardone, because of
your doubt you are contemptible, and in no
wise deserving of God's mercy."</p>

<p class='c000'>Then, rising, he went toward the palace
with a serene countenance.</p>

<p class='c000'>Having watched Francis enter into the
palace, the eleven companions continued to
pace up and down in the cool shadow of the
wall, and to discourse to each other upon
grave matters.</p>

<p class='c000'>"How is it, Brother Bernard," said Egidio,
"that astrologers are able to foretell all things
that will happen to a man in his journey
through life?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is in this wise," said Brother Bernard,
who had all the wisdom of the schools, "the
earth is the centre of the universe, which
consists of a number of concentric spheres,
all turning, as it were, upon the axle of the
earth; the first is the sphere of the elements,
which is enclosed by the sphere of the moon;
beyond these, in order, circle the six spheres of
Mercury, Venus, the Sun, Mars, Jupiter and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_165'>165</span>Saturn, all turning about the earth; the next
sphere is that wherein the fixed stars are set
like jewels, and beyond that is the <i>Primum
Mobile</i>, whence motion is born and governed.
Last of all is the Empyrean, and there in a
blaze of light God sits enthroned, and all the
spheres make a celestial music about his feet.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Now it is from the order and motion of
these spheres that astrologers get that devilish
wisdom whereby they are enabled to foretell
the future. For each one of the spheres is
governed by a distinct angelical company, who
influence all things under their control; so
that, having ascertained the nature of such
angels as control the sphere of any particular
planet, we are enabled to judge of the nature
and disposition of any mortal born under their
influence; thus it happens that those who are
been under Mercury are of an alert and
capricious disposition, and may be given to
thieving; while those who are born under
Venus are lewd and wanton in their motions,
given over to the lusts of the flesh; and those
influenced by Mars will be great warriors, men
of mettle, hot-tempered, and quick to shed
blood. Moreover, by the conjunctions and
opposition of planets, by comets and portents
in the sky, those skilled in the signs are even
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>able to foretell whether a man shall die in his
youth with all his sins heavy upon him, or in
old age when his flagging pulses have made
him less prone to sin and warned him to
repentance; and we may see men, to whom
astrologers have predicted a long life, pursuing
a course of infamy well on into their old
age, for they know that there is time left for
repentance, whereby they may yet save their
souls. Such is the lamentable wisdom, which
came to us through the transgression of
Adam."</p>

<p class='c000'>They continued in silence a little way,
pondering these things; and then Bernard
spoke again.</p>

<p class='c000'>"In all things," he said, "we may read the
infinite mercies and wisdom of God. For
even as he has made the earth the centre of
the universe, so he has made man the centre of
all created things. Round the throne of God
are the Seraphim and Cherubim singing His
eternal praise, and next to them are the
Thrones, who carry the orders of God unto
the Dominations. These last are the mighty
powers who held back the sun and moon in
their courses, at the prayer of Joshua; and
they inhabit the <i>Primum Mobile</i>, whence all
the planets are moved from east to west.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>Beneath these, are the Virtues and Powers,
ruling the planetary spheres; and finally come
the three orders of Princedoms, Archangels,
and Angels; and to each Angel is given the
guidance of one soul. Now in this order I
have followed the teaching of Dionysius
rather than of Gregory, since the former was
the pupil of St Paul, and therefore of greater
authority.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Many rebellious angels, driven out with
Lucifer, and the host who writhe in Hell
beneath our feet, making the earth tremble,
inhabit the sphere of the elements, and ride
upon all storms, ruling the thunder and
lightning, and opening the flood-gates, and
loosening the tempests of hail; and God hath
given them power over the wicked to lead
them to destruction, but, before the prayers of
the holy, their power is only an empty noise.
How little is the worth of man! Yet all
these immortal spirits are concerned in his
salvation. And God hath set Jerusalem in
the centre of earth's habitable hemisphere, so
that from there the means of salvation might
radiate into all countries, and gather up all
peoples. And yet again is man the centre of
created things, for God hath made him lord
and master of the earth, and of all the birds
<span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>and beasts therein; though, indeed, when he
fell from Paradise in the person of Adam, he
decreased in excellence and became subject to
sin and death."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And for how long a time," enquired one
of the younger brethren, "was Adam in
Paradise?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"For little more than six hours," answered
Bernard, with assurance.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It was a very short time," said the brother
simply.</p>

<p class='c000'>But Egidio was troubled; he touched
Bernard upon the arm.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Beware, little sheep of the Lord," he said
gently, "lest thy great learning make thee
mad, and turn to pride in thy heart."</p>

<h3 class='c012'>II</h3>

<p class='c013'>As the Cardinal Giovanni di San Paolo
entered the audience, the Pope was dictating
a letter to his secretary. He spoke in a low,
clear voice, so clear that it was audible at the
end of the long room.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Among all the princes of the earth," said
Innocent, "we have always cherished with a
particular affection your own person; and the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>more so since the kingdom which you have
inherited is, by the will of your predecessors,
subject and tributary to the Roman Church.
Therefore redeem the promise of your father
liberally and without delay. Your eternal
salvation will be the better assured, and there
will be added to it even such temporal benefits
as the apostolic protection is able to secure.
In acting otherwise you would offend the
Creator. He chastiseth those who do evil
unto his Church, but more particularly
those who detain unjustly the wealth of St
Peter."</p>

<p class='c000'>He motioned the Cardinal toward him,
and taking half a lemon squeezed it into a cup
and drank it. He had a youthful but rather
fleshy face, at once legal and military in its
character. The features were fine, with a
distinctly Roman nobility: a long narrow
nose, almost straight except where it jutted
slightly from the brows; fine lustrous eyes, set
a little too close together; a small mouth,
with thin, rather drooping lips, and a double
chin. The well-chiselled nostrils dilated
sensitively from time to time, otherwise the
whole face was calm, impassive, hieratic. He
began, without any prelude, to speak to the
Cardinal of their business.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>"I have spoken to many of the cardinals
about these penitents of Assisi. Their opinion
is that the rule is too severe, and such an ideal
beyond all human strength."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Your Holiness, I have also urged this
view upon Francis, but, in the simplicity of
his heart, he replies that his rule is taken
from the Gospels: 'If thou wilt be perfect,
go and sell that thou hast, and give to the
poor, and follow me. Take nothing for your
journey, neither staff, nor scrip, nor shoes, nor
money. If any man will come after me, let
him deny himself, and take up his cross and
follow me.' They have vowed to follow this
ideal of evangelical perfection. How can we
withstand them before the world?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"My heart has been moved towards them,"
answered Innocent. "I do not mistrust their
piety, nor doubt the grace by which God has
confirmed them in their design. They may
be steadfast until their death; whereas others
coming after may relax the rule, and their
weakness become a fable in the world."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I doubt not that the rule will be relaxed,"
answered the Cardinal; "their aim is too vague,
too ideal in many ways: complete poverty,
complete obedience, and the preaching of these
virtues. And yet, Holy Father, I have been
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>drawn to these men. By them I feel that
many souls shall be led to God."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You believe that the rule will be relaxed;
and yet you say that we cannot modify this
rule because it consists of definite precepts
taken from the Gospels?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Your Holiness," replied the Cardinal, "if
we say that it is impossible for a man to
follow the precepts of Christ, we blaspheme.
Time modifies all things; and in the meanwhile
these men will draw unto themselves
a great deal of popular sentiment. They are
willing to give us the most absolute obedience,
to be our servants in all things, provided we
approve their desire to live according to the
standard of evangelical perfection. Surely we
should approve their piety."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Similar efforts have failed," answered
Innocent. "It is two years since I approved
the mission of Durando d'Huesca, and for
those two years the bishops have not ceased
to complain of his followers. This fraternity
has a similar constitution. Both confess the
Catholic faith; both desire to give all they
have to the poor, to live themselves in poverty
without care for the morrow, having nothing
but their daily bread and a cloak; both are
open to receive lay members among them."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_172'>172</span>"The difference is in the spirit of their
founders. Francis is a poet," answered the
Cardinal. "He is a troubadour, a vagrant
minstrel, whose lady is Poverty. His speech
is serene, gay, charming. He knows how to
seize upon simple incidents of daily life, and
use them as parables, so that the poor and
humble can understand; and all his teaching
is full of a lyrical emotion that is penetrated
with the love of all things. He burns with
the love of God, and this divine flame is
so strong in him that it enlightens all the
world. There is nothing about him, no bird,
beast, fish, or tree, which does not seem to
him a part of the choir of God, praising the
Lord, and existing entirely for that praise.
Beyond these things he is a true son of the
Church. These penitents, Holy Father, are
so simple: they have faith in some spark of
divinity hidden in the soul of man which
may be awakened by a breath; they believe
that man can be made to see the beauty of
holiness, and that once he has grasped and
recognised this beauty, as a thing existing in
the world about him, he will follow no more
after the beauties of fleshly desires. He
bears the mockery of those who think him
mad with so much patience that they become
<span class='pageno' id='Page_173'>173</span>ashamed. His simplicity draws folk to
him."</p>

<p class='c000'>"All these things are indeed admirable,"
said Innocent in his clear, low speech; "but
alas! how often have the most beautiful
ideals led men into abominable heresies and
destroyed the peace of the Church. Would
that his dream might be realised, and that
all men might seek their salvation through
poverty and obedience. But to us, most
Reverend Father, in our character as Supreme
Pontiff, there are many responsibilities. We
also, if we might choose, would choose the
one thing necessary; Mary's unbounded loving
adoration, in preference to Martha's many
cares. Yet we are content. The divine
wisdom hath shown us that here also salvation
may be gained. We accept our office
with humility, content to be the servant of
the servants of God. Our function is an
ungrateful one, to watch over the welfare of
our flock, and guard them not only from their
enemies but from themselves. Saintly men
have been the cause of mischief in others, and
even the greatest heretics have been men of
holy lives. It behoves us, therefore, to keep
a strict and unceasing watch upon all doctrines
taught to the faithful. We cannot tolerate
<span class='pageno' id='Page_174'>174</span>the teaching and exposition of the Gospels
by a preaching fraternity partly composed of
lay members. We cannot tolerate any action
independent of the bishops. We must insist
that each brother receive the tonsure, and
that they choose one from among themselves
who will be responsible to us; and also, that
none shall preach or direct any mission without
the consent of the bishop. Yet even
now I am doubtful. Perchance this man
may be discouraged. It would be better if
they entered some existing Order."</p>

<p class='c000'>He paused, drank a little more lemon, and
looked keenly at the Cardinal.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Bring him to me," he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Cardinal, having led Francis into the
room, stood apart in the embrasure of a
window overlooking the courtyard. Innocent
fixed his eyes steadily upon the little poor
man of Assisi. Even at their first meeting
he had been struck by the youthful, almost
childish figure, the small, round head, and
the pallor of the lean face, illuminated with
its large patient eyes. It was like watching
a timid wild thing approaching him. Francis
walked with slow, hesitating steps. His
knees and fingers were trembling, his eyes
shone with tears, his face was paler than
<span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>usual, but a smile wavered upon it. He did
not come in fear, but shaken with an emotion
that was partly hope and partly doubt. He
looked toward the seated figure in the chair,
wearing a high tiara of damascened white
cloth rising above a simple pointed crown,
and a white pallium with red crosses. He
hoped for some sign, but the Pope remained
inflexible, his hands laid upon his knees, his
eyes motionless, a figure of impenetrable
reserve; and Francis could find no word to
say. At last he knelt, still trembling, with
the tears streaming from his eyes. The
Cardinal moved in the window; and the
slight noise seemed for a moment to give
Francis confidence.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Father Pope," he began simply; but he
could say no more.</p>

<p class='c000'>"My son," said Innocent at last, moved by
the suffering eyes, "why have you come to
us again?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Father Pope," answered Francis in a sweet,
almost shrill voice, "when you sent me from
you, you did not bid me not to come again."</p>

<p class='c000'>He smiled as he spoke, very simply, winningly,
a smile that was almost a caress. Some
hint of softening in the eyes of the Pope gave
him more confidence.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>"Most Holy Father," he began again, "I
have come to you once more, because you
have not yet granted my request. You are a
great person, whom God has exalted above all
men, and I think that perhaps you had not
time to listen to me, who am the meanest of
God's creatures; so that you did not understand
the excellence of that life which the
Lord hath commanded us to follow. Or perchance
it was that the Lord wished to try my
faith, and, lest I was over-confident in myself,
to show me that without his will I am
capable of nothing, and to humiliate my
pride. Father Pope, I think this last is the
true reason: for how could you not see the
excellence of the way God hath chosen for us,
which is a pattern of the way the disciples
themselves followed?"</p>

<p class='c000'>And the Pope, having no answer to this
candour, sat immobile.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is a little thing that we ask of you,"
continued Francis; "only that you should
approve of our vow to follow a life like that
which the disciples led on the shores of the
Lake of Galilee."</p>

<p class='c000'>"My son," said Innocent, "search well your
heart. Is it not pride which makes you think
that God hath chosen you for this work?"</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>And Francis lowered his head until it
touched the floor.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Why," continued Innocent, "should God
have chosen you among the multitudes of
men?"</p>

<p class='c000'>And Francis raised his head again.</p>

<p class='c000'>"God looked down upon this earth," he
answered humbly, "and he explored all the
ways thereof, and searched into all the souls of
men. And in the whole earth he found no
man so poor in mind, so mean of stature, so
foul with sins, so weak and utterly worthless,
as Francis, the son of Pietro Bernardone; and
for that reason he hath chosen me. For if
folk see that one so miserable as I am can be
uplifted by the grace of God, they will hope
again for themselves; and many who are
caught in the snares of Satan and despair
of their salvation will be freed by this
means."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Is it not pride, my son," the Pope asked of
him after a pause, "that hinders you from
accepting the modifications which I suggest
in your rule?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I shall reason with you," answered Francis;
"tell me one."</p>

<p class='c000'>"That you should not be entirely without
possessions, without a little money."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>"Father Pope," answered Francis sweetly,
"if we were possessed of even the meanest
things, we should have to protect them; and
if we had but a few pence in our scrips there
are those so poor that they would covet them
and desire to steal them; and if a man come
with arms to rob us, should we oppose violence
with violence? Yea, and having a little we
shall not have enough, but each one will seek
to have more than his brother, and so shall discord
and dissension grow among us. And
how, having sufficient, shall we go among
those who have nothing and say to them:
'Brothers, be not cast down, for the wealth of
this world is but dust and ashes. Seek not
after it, but praise God for what he hath
given you; life, and this pleasant earth, the
song of birds, freedom from care, death,
and a treasure in the skies'? Will they not
mock at us? Or how shall we go among
thieves, hiding our gold in our bosoms, and
saying to them: 'Brothers, do not so wickedly,
that which ye steal is but dross, earth digged
out of earth; but holiness is fine gold.' Will
they not mock at us, saying, 'Holiness is
possible with a full belly'? Father Pope,
having no treasure to guard, we shall have no
care; and those among whom we shall go
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>will not lay violent hands upon us, as thieves
and impostors."</p>

<p class='c000'>The Pope hesitated.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Will ye live by mendicancy alone? Will
no idlers come in with you?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Nay," said Francis, "no man shall be idle.
Each one shall work, and their wage will be
their daily bread."</p>

<p class='c000'>He spoke no more, but knelt, waiting.
Innocent had moved. He leant forward a
little, with bent head and knitted brows, looking
fixedly at the curious figure, with the head
of a young faun, kneeling before him in a
coarse stuff cloak, girt with a rope like a halter.
He could not fathom that serene soul. At
last he leaned back in his chair.</p>

<p class='c000'>"My son," he said, in a gentler voice, "our
task is hard. We have the care and oversight
of the whole Church, and all our vigilance is
directed to keeping the holy faith, as it has been
handed down to us, one, pure, and universal.
My son, God hath poured his grace upon you,
and distinguished you with gifts of holiness.
I am not worthy, there is none less worthy
than I, of the charge God has confided to me.
Pray for me, that I may be enlightened. On
every side the Church is being menaced: by
subtle and dangerous enemies without, and by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>schisms and heresies within. Therefore it is
necessary for me to avoid the multiplication of
new fraternities, however sacred and inspired
with true zeal they may be; for each, through
the peculiarity of their nature, and their particular
devotion to one aspect of the religious
life, is liable to be cut off from the main
body of Holy Church; nay, even to become an
hindrance, an annoyance, a little sect separated
from the communion of the faithful. For all
these reasons I can only advise you, as I have
before, to join some existing Order."</p>

<p class='c000'>Francis rose from his knees. He had a sense
of being crushed by a cruel and superior force.
His eyes were dry; but he saw nothing. He
turned and moved slowly toward the door.
Innocent made a sudden gesture of disappointment.
Francis took a few more steps, hesitated,
and then turned.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Father Pope," he said, "there was once
in the desert a woman, very poor but beautiful.
A great king seeing her beauty desired to
take her to wife, that by her he might have
beautiful children. So it was done; and many
children were born to him. And when the
children were grown up, their mother spoke to
them, saying: 'My children, you have no reason
to be ashamed, for you are the sons of the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>king; go, therefore, to his court, and he will
give you all things that are necessary to you.'
And when they had arrived, the king admired
their beauty, and finding in them his own
likeness, he spoke to them, saying: 'Whose
sons are ye?' And when they had answered
that they were the sons of a poor woman
dwelling in the desert, the king embraced
them with great joy, crying: 'Fear not, because
you are mine own sons. If strangers eat at
my table, shall I turn away those who are
my lawful children?' And the king commanded
the woman that she should send him
all the sons whom she had borne, in order that
he might care for them."</p>

<p class='c000'>He paused for a moment, and then continued:</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am, Holy Father, that poor woman,
whom God in his love has deigned to make
beautiful, and by whom it has pleased him
to have lawful children. The King of kings
has told me that he will nourish all the
children he has by me, for if he nourishes
bastards, how much more should he nourish
his lawful children?"</p>

<p class='c000'>He spoke the last words vehemently, standing
rigid before Innocent, with blazing eyes;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>and the Pope sat immobile, watching him
with inscrutable calm.</p>

<p class='c000'>"My son, come here," said Innocent at last.</p>

<p class='c000'>The Cardinal turned from the window, and
looked from one to another with equal interest.
He was a worldly man, and the mere contact
with the world had been sufficient to make
him more human than the Pope: unconsciously,
disinterestedly, he was summing up
the characters of the two men before him.
The fact that he was inferior to both fitted
him to judge them, made him swift to see the
flaws and defects in their diverse characters:
Innocent's hard legalism and military instincts;
the blithe and elusive spirituality of Francis, a
nature free as air, too diverse, too liquid, too
impracticable and fleeting, to have any but a
momentary effect. He smiled at the comedy;
it was no more to him. Behind his cynicism
was a kind of tolerance, a charitable irony,
a contemptuous love. The fact that both
these men recognised an ideal, and denied
the manifold pleasures of life to follow after
it, baffled and perplexed him. That ironical
attitude from which, within himself, he considered
them, was the tribute which small
imaginations pay to the great. He was content
to be a spectator, and was willingly
<span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>amused by the readiness with which each of
these men detected the weak spot in the
other, while remaining blind to his own.</p>

<p class='c000'>Innocent stretched out his hand to Francis
and drew him toward the chair. Francis
knelt.</p>

<p class='c000'>"My son, let us try to understand one
another," said the Pope amicably, as he laid
his hand on the other's head. "How is it
possible for us to avoid seeing in thy courage
and perseverance the directing hand of God?
Be assured that we have been moved solely
by our desire to work for the good of the
Church, and the welfare of those who follow
thee. We would not have thee depart from
us with bitterness in thy heart. Listen, therefore,
and be content with what we propose.
Is not one condition of thy rule obedience?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"We shall be obedient to you in all things,
save in any abrogation of the rule, for that
way was shown to us by the mercy of Christ
himself."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Thou dost yet mistrust us," said the
Pope, smiling. "Know, then, that thou hast
our permission to follow that way of life
which has been revealed to you, to practise
poverty and the evangelical virtues. Art thou
content?"</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>"Yea, I am content," answered Francis,
with a radiant face.</p>

<p class='c000'>"But," continued Innocent, checking him;
"and herein thou shalt show thy filial
obedience to us: thou and thy companions
shall receive the tonsure at the hands of the
Cardinal Giovanni di San Paolo, so that
henceforth ye may be identified with the
Church; and, secondly, ye shall choose one
from among you who shall be responsible to
us for all; and, thirdly, in whatsoever place ye
may be, ye shall be subject unto the bishop,
yielding him the most implicit obedience, and
in no wise seeking to preach without his leave.
Art thou content?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yea, I am content," answered Francis,
"so that you approve our rule."</p>

<p class='c000'>"We give thee permission to follow the
rule, and to preach to the people," said the
Pope clearly, "and if thy fraternity becomes
great, and many flock to you, then thou shalt
come to us again, and we shall formally
approve thine Order. Meanwhile thou hast
the permission. Pray for me, my son, that the
Lord may reveal to me the way of righteousness.
Most Reverend Father, let my secretary
be summoned."</p>

<p class='c000'>As the Cardinal led Francis from the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>audience, the Pope watched them. He sat
for some time in thought. The secretary
entered, and sitting at the table began to
sharpen a new pen. Then Innocent lifted
his head. He dismissed Francis from his
mind as completely as if the little poor man
had never existed, and concerned himself
with the question of the heretical Albigeois,
and the case of Count Raymond of Toulouse.
The Count had on a previous occasion
objected to the appointment, as legate, of
the Abbot of Citeaux, who was notoriously
his enemy; and it was now the business of
the Pope to console the powerful Abbot for
the fact that he could not be the direct representative
of the Holy See at the Count's
approaching trial, nor in the final settlement
of the whole question of the Albigeois; and
for the appointment in his room of Maître
Thédise. He was careful to point out that
Thédise was not a legate, but a mere delegate
of the Church.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He shall merely execute thy prescriptions,"
he dictated in his low, clear voice. "He shall
be thy tool, thy voice, the bait which covers
the hook of thy sagacity. Raymond is like a
sick man, for whom a kindly physician will
help to sweeten the bitterness of his medicine;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>he would take thy remedy more patiently
from the hands of another."</p>

<p class='c000'>And the secretary's quill scratched busily
over the fine parchment.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c000'>When the companions of Francis saw him
returning to them, they ran to meet him, and
seeing from afar the joy that shone upon his
face, they were glad and gave thanks to God.
And when he had come up to them and told
them the conditions which he had agreed to
with the Pope, with one voice they chose him
for their head, and kneeling before him made
a vow of obedience. And brother Egidio
suddenly remembered the command and duty
which Francis had laid upon him, and he
rose.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Francis, son of Pietro Bernardone," he
said, "because of thy doubt thou art contemptible
and in no wise worthy of God's
mercy."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is true," said Francis, kneeling before
him, and thanking him. Then in a group
they left the courtyard, he in the middle and
the others surrounding him, and presently
one heard no sound but that of the fountain
singing in the sunlight.</p>

<div>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>
  <h3 class='c012'>III</h3>
</div>

<p class='c013'>It was with joy that Francis and his companions
left Rome. As soon as they had
received the tonsure, and prayed together at
the shrine of the Apostles, they set out northward
by the Porta Salaria, taking nothing for
the journey, neither staff, nor scrip, nor shoes,
nor any money; but trusting all things to
God, whose children they were. At first
they passed little farms and inns, and in the
distance saw a few flocks and shepherds
moving slowly over the plains; but in a little
while the houses became rare, and the only
sounds were from the larks in the skies. They
had drawn their cowls over their heads to
protect them from the fierce sun, and the dust
rising from their feet covered them with a
fine grey powder. But in the gaiety of their
hearts they felt none of these things, but
were quickened with the joy of their triumph,
quickened also with the sense that they were
returning homeward, to the hills of Assisi
and the sweet air of their fields. Their eyes
followed the larks into the skies, and they
felt that their own souls sang like that above
the earth.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>"Praised be thou, O Lord, for our brothers
the larks," said Francis; "at dawn they sing
to thee, and at noon and at eve; their blithe
singing gladdens the heart of man."</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet in that vast silence the voices of the
larks seemed thin and small. There was no
motion in the air except the trembling of
the heat, and the straight road they followed
stretched far away into the distance.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Where shall we sleep to-night?" said
Giovanni.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Where God wills," answered Francis.
"Our brother the body is a cell, and the soul
is a monk inhabiting it."</p>

<p class='c000'>Their faces were thick with dust, and the
sweat from their brows traced runnels in it;
their lips were parched, and their eyes ached
from the dazzling light. On all sides lay the
great plains, and no trees rose out of them.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I thirst," said Angelo.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Perhaps we shall pass a little stream,"
answered Francis. "Be not cast down. At
evening we shall look back on all that we
have suffered for our Lady Poverty, and we
shall be glad. It will rejoice us that we
have been tried, and have not been found
unworthy."</p>

<p class='c000'>Yet the sun had not declined much from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>the zenith, and it was long until the evening.
Their feet dragged wearily.</p>

<p class='c000'>"God hath forsaken us," said Giovanni.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Cast that thought from thee, my brother,"
said Francis. "Though we perish here in this
desert place, God hath not forsaken us. Shall
we faint at a little suffering, we who were
proud at dawn? Surely we should suffer a
little for his sake, who suffered so much for
ours."</p>

<p class='c000'>But they had grown feverish with the heat;
they gasped and sobbed, swaying like drunken
men, muttering as if in a delirium; and a great
fear covered Francis, as he watched them.</p>

<p class='c000'>"My God," he prayed silently, yet moving
his parched lips, "if I have done anything
accounted worthy in thy sight, grant that I
may suffer for these. Let us not perish utterly."</p>

<p class='c000'>They sank down one by one beside the
dusty road, and the fierce heat streamed down
on them: one or two muttered, but most of
them lay still.</p>

<p class='c000'>"My God, why hast thou deserted me?"
prayed Francis in a broken voice.</p>

<p class='c000'>And Egidio, lying delirious upon the ground,
looked at him with glazed, unrecognising eyes,
and muttered to him:</p>

<p class='c000'>"Francis, son of Pietro Bernardone, because
<span class='pageno' id='Page_190'>190</span>of thy doubt thou art contemptible, and in no
wise worthy of the mercy of God."</p>

<p class='c000'>And Francis covered his face with his hands,
and lay beside his companions.</p>

<p class='c000'>"If it be thy will, my Lord; if it be thy
will."</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c000'>He felt water sprinkled on his face, and a
little wine poured between his lips.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Who are you who travel in this wise,
through the fierce heat, without food or drink,
and half naked? If I had not seen you, and
come to your aid, you would have perished
by the wayside."</p>

<p class='c000'>The bottle was thrust between his lips
again, and he swallowed a good draught; as
he swum back into consciousness, he heard
the voice of Egidio:</p>

<p class='c000'>"We are penitents from Assisi, who have
been to Rome that the Pope might approve
our rule, and we were returning homeward
when the fierce heat struck us down."</p>

<p class='c000'>"From Rome," said the deep mellow voice.
"Then you have been travelling on foot through
the hot noon. It is wonderful that you got
so far. But for my wine you would have
lain there till the end of time. Art thou
stronger?"</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_191'>191</span>The last words were to Francis, who had
opened his eyes.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yea. Thanks to thee," answered Francis.
"God will reward thee, my brother."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Doubtless," answered the other. "But
who is to pay me for my wine? You be
twelve fools, without a wise man among you."</p>

<p class='c000'>Francis looking about him saw that most
of his companions were sitting up eating bread,
and looking at him stupidly. All were sick
and weary. The stranger who had helped
them was a tall young man driving a hooded
wine-cart. He had a plump, handsome face,
magnificent limbs, and a general air of well-being.</p>

<p class='c000'>"None of us can pay thee," answered
Francis, "nay, not even for thy wine, which
was the least part of thy kindness. Shall
we pay thee for our lives with our lives?
We have given them to God."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I want no payment," said the young
man, ashamed. "See, I shall leave you this
other small flask of wine. It hath grown
cooler; the sun is sinking, and an hour will
bring you to Orte. Yea, indeed I see that
you are saintly livers, yet I have called you
fools."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is right that you should call us fools,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_192'>192</span>my brother," answered Francis. "We are
sinful men, who follow the way which God
hath shown us, and have no wisdom in worldly
things. We are fools for Christ's sake. Yea,
we are the fools of God, and by our folly
seek to draw men toward him. But thy
kindliness and mercy shown to us, my brother,
is a good deed, which like a seed thrown in
the ground shall flourish and bear fruit.
Yea, though thou seest it not. And when
thou goest before God at the last, he will
take two apples out of his robe, an apple
of gold and an apple of silver, and he will
speak to thee, saying: 'Lo, here is thy payment
for that thou hast succoured my children
on earth; these be the fruit of the seed which
thou then plantedst.'"</p>

<p class='c000'>But the young man blushed shamefully.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Suffer me now to go," he said. "Thou
hast made me ashamed. Yet if thou shouldst
pray for me, pray also for my beloved, who
is called Vanna."</p>

<p class='c000'>He climbed into his cart, and continued
on the way they had come, the bells tinkling
upon his mule. And after a little time, when
they were rested, they went their own way,
with great weariness of body and in silence
because they were still dazed and giddy. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_193'>193</span>coming to Orte, they entered into an ancient
ruined tomb, where they determined to abide
for that night, and some peasants gave them
enough food. Then sitting in the starlight,
they praised God for his mercy.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Surely," said Francis, "he who succoured
us was an angel sent from God, for how else
could we have been rescued from death?"</p>

<p class='c000'>And they marvelled that they had not
known him for an angel, and with great joy
they praised God.</p>

<hr class='c011' />

<p class='c000'>"They were twelve fools," said the young
man to Vanna; "but for me they would have
perished by the roadside."</p>

<p class='c000'>"God was good to them," she answered
simply; and again he was ashamed.</p>

</div>

<p class='c006'>Taking a pen from the table, he mended it
to his own fashion, and wrote:</p>

<p class='c000'>"Thomas Cromwell to his most excellent
friend, Master William Bates, greeting. I
am removed to the farmhouse of La Strada
at San Casciano for a short time, having left
Florence on account of the great heat and
an indisposition of my stomach, caused by a
surfeit of raw ham and figs: for it is the
custom of this people, when the figs ripen,
to make an excursion to their villas, or the
farms of their tenants, and having brought
with them a number of small hams, smoked
and excellently well flavoured, which they
cut into thin slices, they sit in the shade of a
fig-tree, and make a great feasting. Messer
Frescobaldi carried me to such a feast at one
of his neighbouring villas, and I, whether
from the novelty of the dish, which savours
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>deliciously, and is exciting to the palate, or
from a natural intemperance of appetite,
having eaten immoderately of figs and ham,
and having drunk a vast quantity of wine,
was seized on my return to Florence with
violent pains and cramps in the stomach,
accompanied by much retching and colic.
Messer Frescobaldi, having sent for his
physician to come to me, I was blooded
eight ounces, and am now somewhat recovered,
though in much need of rest, and
the coolness of the country air.</p>

<p class='c000'>"But since I am charged with the execution
of your business rather than with the recreation
of mine own health, let me say that the
matter of the Lucca merchants is settled, on
the terms mentioned in the enclosed treaty,
and such produce as you require will be
sent as occasion offers, whether by France
or Antwerp, depending upon the state of the
rival nations; but in so far as is possible
the goods will be shipped at Genoa by the
Fuggers, and carried thence to Antwerp, to
be reladed at your own charge, and carried
to your brother at Boston, or on a ship of
the Fuggers' trading with England, in which
case they will be delivered to yourself at
the sign of the Blue Anchor, in Chepeside.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>The late ordinances directing that all shrouds
shall be made of woollen, and forbidding the
export of raw wool out of England, and the
question of the staple, have caused much ill-feeling
against English merchants, both at
Antwerp and Florence; wherefore I think
it would be wise to commission the Fuggers
to buy for you, and to colour your goods
with their name, more especially in the Baltic
trade. The same offices will, at your request,
be undertaken by Messer Frescobaldi here
and throughout Italy, both with the cloth
merchants of Florence and the glass workers
and silk merchants of Venice; but, in matters
connected with your trade with the latter
town, Messer Frescobaldi demands that you
place a sum of money in his bank, sufficient
to cover the charges of the import and the
export duty, or, that such moneys as he may
advance on your behalf for the payment of
these imposts be charged against you at
one and a half per cent. above the current
rate, so that in the one case he hath the
use of your money, and in the other a large
interest upon his own. You will easily see
by the treaty that I have relinquished to him
rather the shadow than the substance of what
he desired; but I do feel it my duty to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_200'>200</span>beseech you that in every wise you show
him such convenience and fair dealing as
you may, without hurt to your own prosperity,
since by your acting in this fashion he will
be the less likely to repudiate the contract
as a cheat devised for his beguiling.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Returning to mine own affairs. I am the
guest of one Niccolo Machiavelli, an honest
and courteous man, with much wit, and
knowledge of the ancients. He was sometime
in the service of the late Republic, but
was after suspected, and removed from his
office by the Medici faction. Having been
racked on a false charge of treason, he retired
hither, and by a frugal expenditure hath
somewhat mended his fortune, so that he is
embarrassed neither by the cares of wealth,
nor the vexations of poverty. At first, however,
since a republican and popular government
considers all the citizens to be its
servants, as much through their own duty
as from any hope of a fair remuneration, he,
having been able to save little of his pay,
was in great straits, so that he was forced
to rise ere it was light, and spread nets for
thrushes and quails, superintend his idle workmen,
and busy himself with a thousand trifling
cares: wherefore I think it more profitable
<span class='pageno' id='Page_201'>201</span>to serve a tyrant than a free people. He
hath now acquired by his own efforts that
leisure which his public service and former
poverty denied him, so that he can pass his
day in pleasant discourse, studying the diverse
manners and habits of men, or reading in
his library, in which he doth greatly delight.
The library itself, in which I am now writing,
is a long, airy room, having a pleasant aspect
toward the south-west; but it overlooks the
courtyard, and one is continually disturbed
through the day by the foolish cackle of
hens and other farmyard racket. He told
me that he chose the room on his first coming
hither, whereat his wife made a great clamour
complaining that he had taken for his own
uses the one serviceable room in the house,
which is indeed the truth. She is well
looking and I would willingly see more of
her; but she is a notable woman, and, as
is usual with her sex, occupied all day long
by a thousand nothings, whereat I think
he is marvellously contented, esteeming himself
fortunate in that she differs from the
majority of wives, who continually invade
the privacy of men, and use our apartments
as their own. Set against the walls are great
chests of carven and painted wood, which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_202'>202</span>contain his manuscripts and printed books,
the Latin poets as well as the historians and
orators, besides those Italian authors who
have gained an eternity of fame, more
especially Dante Alighieri and Petrarch.
Here, among this choice store of what the
world hath accounted noble in thought or
action, we sit far into the night with a flagon
of wine between us, and such entertainment
as our own wits provide, relishing in our
conversation both the <i>sal nigrum</i> of Momus,
and the <i>sal candidum</i> which Mercurius gave.</p>

<p class='c000'>"At first, seeing the ingenious and subtle
mind of my friend, I was at a loss to account
for his apparent failure in assuring his own
fortune; but, knowing him better, I see that
his judgment, never at fault in dealing with
things afar off, may be perplexed and misled
when it comes to bear upon present affairs;
being so great in himself he doth sometimes
forget of what poor account in Europe are his
countrymen to-day. He is at present making
a series of discourses upon politics, which he
reads in the gardens of Cosimo Rucellai,
where the meetings of the Academy are held.
It was at one of these meetings, after the
company had dispersed, that I first had speech
of him; in which traverses, though the chief
<span class='pageno' id='Page_203'>203</span>subject of his discourse is Livy's history of the
Roman Republic, he draweth his examples
from many sources, and showeth how mankind
hath always been prone to the same faults,
and in like circumstances will always act in
a like manner without regard for the lessons
and warnings of the past.</p>

<p class='c000'>"In the intervals of preparing these discourses
against their occasions, and of refining those
which he hath read, he giveth much time and
labour to the polishing of a little treatise or
manual for princes; a work full of seasonable
matter, which I have read with much profit
and agreement, for he reasons not, as the
schoolmen use, from some abstract theory of the
universe, with which all events must be forced
into harmony, but gathering together the facts
of common experience, he derives from the
perfect understanding of them the principles
of his philosophy; wherefore I say that he hath
invented a new science, and added a tenth
muse to the choir of Apollo. And to show
you the satiric nature of the man, I must tell
you, that having dedicated his treatise of <i>The
Prince</i> to Lorenzo di Piero de' Medici, in the
hope of some advancement and reward, and
being disappointed of this hope, in the dedication
of his <i>Discourses</i> to Zanobi Buondelmonte
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>and Cosimo Rucellai he says, 'Though I
have been mistaken on many occasion, yet
certainly I have made no error in offering
my <i>Discourses</i> to you. For in this I think
to have shown some gratitude for benefits
received, and to have abandoned the path
habitually trodden by those who make a trade
of writing, and whose custom it is to dedicate
their works to some prince, to whom, in the
blindness of their ambition or of their avarice,
and in the pouring out of their empty flatteries,
they attribute all the virtues, instead of making
him blush for his vices. To avoid falling into
that vulgar fault I have made choice, not
indeed of a prince, but of those who merit to be
princes.... Moreover, historians give greater
praise to Hieron, a plain citizen of Syracuse,
than to Perseus, King of Macedonia, for
Hieron lacked none of the qualities of kingliness,
except the name, while Perseus had no
other than the kingdom.' So doth he think
to repay them for their neglect.</p>

<p class='c000'>"This satiric quality doth characterise all his
writing, whether he be dealing with the sacred
or the profane; indeed he doth make no
difference between the books of Moses and
the books of Livy, but treats both in the
same way, as the record of past events; and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>though God forbid that I should seem to
doubt the truth of Scripture, yet it is my
opinion that the writings of Moses are not to
be apprehended by the plain man, being full
of mystery and divinity, which only a clerk
can expound. Thus, in one place, after
enumerating the great law-givers of old;
Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, Theseus, and the like,
he adds: 'And though perhaps I ought not
to name Moses, he being merely an instrument
for carrying out the divine commands, he is
still to be admired for those qualities which
made him worthy to converse with God; but
if we consider Cyrus and the others who have
acquired or founded kingdoms, they will all
be seen to be admirable, and if their actions
and the particular institutions of which they
were the authors be studied, they will be
found not to differ from those of Moses,
though he was instructed by so great a
teacher.'</p>

<p class='c000'>"This is either too simple, or too subtile, for
men of godly and pious dispositions. Indeed,
I think that by indulging his delight in irony
he hath made himself distrusted; for the
depravity of human nature is such, that, where
two interpretations can be put upon words,
mankind will ordinarily choose the sense which
<span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>is evil instead of that which is good. Witness
the following, on ecclesiastical princedoms:
'All the difficulties of ecclesiastical
princedoms precede their acquisition: for they
are acquired by merit or good fortune, but are
maintained without either, being upheld by
the venerable ordinances of religion, which
are all of such a nature and efficacy that they
secure the authority of their princes in whatever
way they may act or live. These princes
alone have territories which they do not defend,
and subjects whom they do not govern; yet,
though undefended, their territories are not
taken from them, nor are their subjects concerned
at not being governed or led to think
of throwing off their allegiance; nor is it in
their power to do so. Accordingly these
princedoms alone are secure and happy. But
inasmuch as they are sustained by agencies
of a higher nature than the mind of man can
reach, I forbear to speak of them; for, since
they are set up and supported by God himself,
he would be a rash and presumptuous man
who should venture to discuss them.' It hath
a double edge, and though some may be found
to declare the intention innocent, since the
book is addressed to a relative of the Pope, I
would rather infer from that the greater daring
<span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>of the author. But lest you yourself, who are
curious in such matters, should doubt whether
the intention be malicious or innocent, I shall
explain further his opinions, both in the matter
of Moses, and in the matter of ecclesiastical
princedoms. For in two discourses at the
Rucellai gardens, at which I was present, he
returned to these subjects, and said: 'In fact
no legislator has ever given his people a new
body of laws, without alleging the intervention
of the divinity; for otherwise they would
not have been accepted. It is certain that
there exist many benefits of which a wise and
prudent man foresees the consequences, but
nevertheless of which the evidence is not
sufficiently striking to convince all minds.
To resolve that difficulty the wise man hath
recourse to the gods.... The Florentines
believe themselves to be neither ignorant
nor rude, and, nevertheless, Fra Girolamo
Savonarola made them believe that he had
conversations with God. I do not pretend
to decide if he were right or wrong, for one
should not speak without respect of so extraordinary
a man. I only say, that a great
multitude of people believed him, without
having seen anything supernatural which
could justify their belief; but his whole life,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_208'>208</span>his knowledge, and the subject of his discourses,
should have been enough to make
them give credence to his words. One must
never be astonished at having failed to-day,
where others once succeeded; for mankind,
as I have said in my preface, are born, live,
and die, according to the same laws.'</p>

<p class='c000'>"And if you, Master Bates, would ask me
how it is possible that such matters should
be so spoken of, openly, in this country, which
licence would not be permitted elsewhere, I
shall offer in reply his own words on ecclesiastical
princedoms. For he says: 'Certainly,
if religion had been able to maintain itself as
a Christian republic, such as its divine founder
had established, the States which professed
it would have been happier than they are now.
But how is she fallen! and the most striking
proof of her decadence is to see that the
peoples bordering on the Church of Rome,
that capital of our religion, are precisely the
least religious. If one examines the primitive
spirit of her institutions, and when he sees
how far her practice hath departed from them,
he might easily believe that we are approaching
a time of ruin or of retribution. And,
since some assert that the happiness of Italy
depends on the Church of Rome, I should
<span class='pageno' id='Page_209'>209</span>bring against that Church several reasons
which offer themselves to my mind, among
which there are two extremely grave, and
which I think, cannot be denied. First, the
evil examples of the court of Rome have
extinguished in this country all devotion and
all religion, which fact carries in its train
innumerable inconveniences and disorders;
and as, wherever religion reigns one must
believe the existence of good, so wherever
it hath disappeared one must suppose the
presence of evil. We owe it then, we other
Italians, to the Church and to the priests that
we are without religion or morals, but we owe
them one other obligation, which is the source
of our ruin; it is that the Church has always
stirred up, and stirs up incessantly, the division
of this unhappy country.'</p>

<p class='c000'>"My mind doth see you, sitting, perchance,
in your garden, by the dial, as is your wont
after the business of the day is over, and
mocking me, that I have found a new prophet.
But, indeed, it doth seem so to me, and I am
content to sit in his company gleaning the
ripe ears of his wisdom. And if I have out-wearied
your patience with my praise of him,
whose every word hath the force of a deed,
let me remind you of a summer day in the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_210'>210</span>garden of your old house at Boston, how we
plucked the apricocks from the espaliers, while
you read to me the discourses of Sir Thomas
More upon Augustine's <i>De Civitate Dei</i>,
when, if I did not gape, it was but from
politeness and my great respect for yourself.
For this man doth stand among his countrymen
like a giant in a city of pigmies, overlooking
their petty disputations, and reading
the future from the mirror of the past. He
doth foresee the ruin of the Church, the birth
of Empires, the dawn of a new greatness for
the world, the emancipation of the peoples
from the ecclesiastical tyranny of to-day. He
standeth like one prophetic upon Pisgah. He
doth see that the world must be freed from
this pestilence of monks. He says: 'Our
religion, having shown us the truth and the
only way of salvation, hath lessened in our
eyes the worth of worldly honours.... The
ancient religions offered divine honours only
to those illustrious with worldly glory, such as
famous captains, and leaders of the Republic;
our religion, on the contrary, only sanctifies
the humble, and men given to contemplation
rather than to an active life; she hath placed
the <i>summum bonum</i> in humility, in the contempt
for worldly things, and even in abjection;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_211'>211</span>while the pagans made it consist in
greatness of soul, in bodily strength, and in
all that might help to make men brave and
robust. And if our religion asks us to have
strength, it is rather the strength to suffer
evils than to do great things. It seems that
this new morality has made mankind weaker,
and given the world over as a prey to the
wicked.'</p>

<p class='c000'>"All these sayings have sunk deep into my
mind, as you may well perceive by the length
of this letter. He hath taught me that, since
the conditions of life are always the same, a
man who hath strength and wit may rise to
the same eminence in these days as the heroes
of old time did in the past.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have sent to my lord the Cardinal a
present of furs, which I pray you see conveyed
to him with my humble duty. The
cloak of furs is for yourself, and the necklace
of amber beads for your good lady. Your
advice I follow in my way of life; but, my
good Will, sometimes I do regret the old
times, when you and I were younger, and
fond of wenches; or, perchance, when they
were fonder of us. Three things I look forward
to seeing next Spring: the fresh face
of an English country maid, a Royal pageant
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>on the Thames, and a bank of primroses with
the rain on them."</p>

<p class='c000'>Folding the paper neatly, he addressed it;
and taking a sardonyx gem from his finger
sealed up the edges with four seals. Then
returning the ring to his finger, he considered
his small, white, fat hands, pursing up his
lips, with a curious air of meditative self-satisfaction.
Lifting up his eyes again, after
this pleasant relaxation of the mind, he found
Machiavelli, who had entered softly so as not
to disturb him if he were writing, looking at
him with a gently ironic smile; and he started,
somewhat annoyed that even for a moment
he should have been taken off his guard.</p>

<p class='c000'>"If you are occupied, Messer, I shall not
disturb you. Do not move. I hope that you
have asked for whatever you may have desired.
Marietta tells me that you have been busy
with your correspondence."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have also read a little," answered
Cromwell.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah, I see! the <i>De Monarchia</i>. I marvel
always, Messer, that in spite of the overwhelming
evidence of human depravity, men are to
be found in every age who base their conceptions
of the ideal state upon the hypothesis
that mankind is naturally good."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>"It is at least certain that each individual
considers himself good," Cromwell said.</p>

<p class='c000'>A light smile was the only reply. Machiavelli
wore a long Florentine cloak reaching
down to the ankles; loosening it a little he
flung the ends back over the arms of his
chair, and stretched his legs. His clothes
were of the finest Florentine cloth, well-made,
but a little worn--black and dark green in
colour; he wore a collar of fine linen fitting
close about the neck; his cloak was of brown
home-spun. Every detail showed a scrupulous
care for his appearance, but also a frugality of
means. Cromwell, equally sober in his black
and tawny, allowed himself little vanities; a
gold chain with pendant jewels, and the white
lawn collar neatly goffered, as also were the
wrist-bands.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Do you think this treatise a foolish book?"
asked Cromwell bluntly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Dante was great in everything," answered
Machiavelli. "He could not write foolish
things; but he could be mistaken in his
reasons, and as to the capacity of human
nature. His ideal Emperor, his ideal Pope,
would be gods, not men. His notion of the
Church stripped of its temporal possessions
is a chimera. As religion exists to-day,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_214'>214</span>asserting its precedence over the State, or
even its opposition to the State, it splits
society in two, and divides it against itself.
The religion of the pagans was merged in
patriotism, and before a greater stability in
social affairs is possible, mankind must either
return to that ideal, or religion be considered
as a matter for every individual to practise
as he thinks best."</p>

<p class='c000'>He spoke with little or no inflection of the
voice, resting his chin on one hand. As he
sat always with his head slightly bent, when
he looked at his companion, with bright
eyes under compressed brows, his face had
an expression of stealthy alertness.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes," said Cromwell; "if we turn away
from Italy, and consider the other nations,
we find that in every country the Church has
an organisation, powerful and rich, which the
State has to bribe; but since the Church has
this organisation, acting directly on the mass
of the people, and willing to support the
State, in exchange for certain privileges and
immunities, our princes find it convenient to
govern by its help; and since the greater
part of government consists of temporary
expedients, statesmen will not be led easily
to forego this convenience."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>"That little book was written when Boniface
VIII. sat in the chair of Peter. It is simply
a protest against the ambition and arrogant
pretensions of the popes. Innocent III. and
Gregory VII. could launch their thunders
against kings more or less successfully; but
the anger of Boniface went out like a flame
fallen in water; his selfish lust for power led
to his complete downfall, and the victory of
Philip. But Philip's victory caused a revulsion
of feeling in the Pope's favour, so that Dante,
though he hath thrust Boniface into Hell, yet
calleth him Christ's Vicar, and doth compare
his sufferings to Christ's Passion. Even Philip
did not attack him openly, but used covert
weapons, Sciarra and all the Colonnesi being
his secret allies, and carrying with them the
gonfalon of the Church; in what he did openly,
Philip used traditional means, as summoning
a council, and accusing the Pope of heresy.
Still, I say to you that henceforth the great
States will war continuously against the
Church."</p>

<p class='c000'>"And how should they attack her? Upon
what side is the Church to be assailed?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Through the monks. 'The fat bellies of
the monks' are become a proverb in Europe.
Every people itch with the vermin. They
<span class='pageno' id='Page_216'>216</span>have made the practice of poverty the most
lucrative of trades. Their greed, their lewdness,
and their obscenity, are the matter of
every ballad, and the butt of every wit. And
yet they are one of the chief supports of the
Church, ever replenishing her treasuries with
the offerings of the poor, and the fruit of their
traffic in pardon and indulgences."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have observed," said Cromwell, "that,
though kings have often despoiled the monasteries,
such depredations have not increased
their popularity; for, though the people do
not defend the property of the monks when
it is attacked, after a time the weight of
their opinion is on the side of the Church,
and they accuse the officers of the State of
rapacity and harshness, and the King himself
of greed."</p>

<p class='c000'>"The people are too often ground between
the upper and nether mill-stones of Church
and State," said Machiavelli; "to them both
tyrannies are equally hateful. And, also,
Messer, the plundering of the monasteries hath
nearly always been an act of kingly greed, to
furnish the material for war and forge the
instruments of a harsher tyranny. But let the
King make his people his accomplices...."</p>

<p class='c000'>He finished the sentence with a smile.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_217'>217</span>"Yes," said the other slowly; "yes."</p>

<p class='c000'>He considered his soft, white hands, and
pondered the matter as if it were an ordinary
question of daily business. His fleshy face
with a bright colour about the cheek-bones,
the small, pointed nose, the watchful eyes,
revealed nothing; but the mere quietness with
which he considered the question was, in a
sense, a revelation. Lifting his eyes again he
spoke quietly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I see here," he said, turning the pages of
the <i>De Monarchia</i>, "that Dante attributes
the great power of the Roman Empire to the
direct action of the divine providence. The
Empire to him is a thing divinely ordained,
and Augustus is the divine monarch."</p>

<p class='c000'>"One must either attribute all things or
nothing to providence," said Machiavelli.
"It was the opinion of Plutarch that the
Romans confessed their obligations to Fortune
by consecrating a great number of temples
and statues to that goddess. It was to the
courage of her soldiers that Rome owed the
Empire, and it was to the wisdom and
conduct of her administrators and law-givers
that she owed its preservation. If fortune or
God rule the world, then man hath no remedy
against the evils of his time, and his prudence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_218'>218</span>avails him nothing. I am in part inclined to
this opinion, since every day we see things
happen contrary to all human expectation;
yet, at the same time, man is in some measure
free. What I say, then, is this: that fortune
is mistress of little more than half of our
actions, and man himself is master of all the
rest. In all things we may observe the action
of certain laws, to which man is subject, but
within the limits of which he hath a certain
freedom. So, as a sailor, knowing the changes
of the tide and wind; how it bloweth from
the shore at evening, and from the sea at
dawn; and knowing also the mysterious
currents in the sea, and the hidden shallows,
and the free channels, and the stars by which
he is to steer, may bring his venture into port,
where one ignorant of these things would
suffer shipwreck, the wise man judging of
times and opportunities will use caution or
courage, as best may serve the occasion. He
will prosper most whose mode of acting is
adapted to the change of times; but no man
is found so prudent as to know how to adapt
himself to all changes, both because he is
naturally inclined to follow one course, and
because having prospered in it hitherto he
cannot be persuaded to change. Moreover,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_219'>219</span>fortune is a blind and irresistible force, while
the divine providence of Dante is mild and
beneficent; and though we have instances of
fortune we have none of providence; and to
assert that fortune directed the growth of the
Roman Empire is to say a childish thing, for
fortune creates nothing, it rather destroys;
but it is man, adapting himself to fortune,
who is the creator. Though we may say that
fortune doth in a large measure control the
works of man, we cannot say that the divine
providence hath inspired or maintained in
power, by its singular favour, any people.
But every people succeeds or fails according
to its wisdom in dealing with events as they
occur, and in guarding against all probabilities
of mischance."</p>

<p class='c000'>While he was speaking, his son, Piero, came
into the room with some wine for them, which
he put upon the table. He was not unlike
his father, with a small, close-cropped head
and slightly aquiline nose, but the face had
the softer outline and delicacy of youth;
something in the clean-cut features, the
thoughtful brows, and firm lips, reminded
Cromwell of a little head of Augustus upon a
gem which he had seen at Rome, but even
more, of a small head of Caligula, that debased
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>and weaker image of Augustus. Machiavelli
smiled, took his son's hand, and talked to
him in that spirit of grave banter which is
customary with men when they talk to
children, and the boy answered him readily
enough, with responsive smiles, and laughingly,
but yet a little embarrassed by the
presence of their guest. Presently his hand
was released, and he slipped silently out of the
room.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is sad when one thinks of the great
empires of the past fallen into decay, and all
their work perished, so that nothing of them
can be said to remain except a shadowy legend
and a name."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, it is sad; but it hath always been so,"
answered Machiavelli. "Everything is subject
to change and death. Do you know these
lines of Dante, since you study him?</p>

And yet we may comfort ourselves. For I
believe that the world has always been the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_221'>221</span>same and has always contained an equal mass
of good and evil, but I believe also that this
good and evil passes from one country to
another, as we may see by the records of these
kingdoms of antiquity, which, as their manners
changed, passed from one to the other, but the
world itself remained the same. There is only
this difference, that whereas first the seat of
the world's greatness was at Assyria, whence
it passed to the Medes, thence into Persia,
until finally it came to Rome and Italy, and
though no other Empire has followed which
has proved lasting, yet now the greatness of
the world is diffused through many nations, in
which men live in orderly and civil fashion.
Everything is subject to change and the
vicissitudes of fortune; but passing from
change to change all things return more or
less to their former state."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I remember the lines. Tell me, Messer:
Dante calleth Virgil his master; do you think
the poetry of Dante similar and equal to
Virgil?"</p>

<p class='c000'>Machiavelli moved a little in his chair.</p>

<p class='c000'>"There is a Virgil by your hand, Messer,"
he said. "Open it. Look at the print and
paper; it was printed at Venice. So I like to
read that splendid verse. And yet Dante
<span class='pageno' id='Page_222'>222</span>scarcely seems a poet to be read in print. I
should like to possess his works written in a
fine, neat, clerkly script, upon vellum, with
little illuminations in the margin, angels in
vermilion and ultramarine upon a golden
ground; initial letters with quaint floral
devices woven about them, heraldic monsters,
the Gryphon with his car, Beatrice walking by
the stream in the earthly Paradise. He chose
Virgil as his master because, to him, Virgil
was the sole Roman to whom the prophecy
of Christ's coming had been revealed by
the divine will; because Virgil himself had
pictured the state of man after death; and,
finally, because Virgil had been the singer
of that Empire which Dante so greatly reverenced.
The poetry of Dante has nothing
of classical proportion; its unity is simply the
unity of a philosophical system; its progress
is like a pageant. But it is full of a sudden
wilful beauty, a delight in natural things,
moments of birdlike music when he speaks
of birds, as in the lines:</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>and you have some notion of his wide range
from tumult into calm. Will you not drink a
little wine?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"This wine is excellent," said Cromwell.
"As a rule I find the Italian wine a little
harsh; but this is suave and of a delicate
flavour. You are a great lover of poetry,
Messer. I see that your volumes of Tibullus
and Ovid are much worn."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I carry them out with me when I go fowling,
and read them beside the snares."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have little time for such pleasures, alas!"
said Cromwell. "Yet I, too, have great need
of the poets, sometimes. I have read the <i>Commedia</i>
closely. Tell me, Messer, since you
have spoken of Dante's political principles as
enunciated in the <i>De Monarchia</i>, did not
they suffer a change in the <i>Commedia</i>?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Man's ideals are broken as he hath greater
experience of life. Dante, like all enthusiasts,
fashioned to his own mind a picture of the
ideal state, upon the hypothesis, as I have said
before, that all men are naturally good. But
if you consider his poem you will find that it
is nothing but a record of crimes and their
punishment, while even the crystal air of
heaven is disturbed by denunciations of evil.
His notion that the civil power is of God, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>that the Church should be subject to it, is
expressed later with even a more vehement
conviction in the <i>Paradiso</i>, by Justinian, the
supreme legist. In the <i>De Monarchia</i> he
says: 'Si romanum imperium de jure non fuit,
peccatum Adae in Christo non fuit punitum';
and in the <i>Commedia</i> for having withstood the
Empire, Brutus with Cassius still howls in
Hell, and 'Piangene ancor la trista Cleopatra.'
But, after his years of exile and wandering,
he seems to have surrendered his faith in a
kingdom, which should be of this world, and
sought for justice and the triumph of the good
beyond the grave, as so many others have,
likewise; for in the next world we shall all be
justified. Dante's poem is not like the <i>Æneid,</i>
an epic: it is an Apocalypse. The companion
of his voyage is less the gentle Virgil, the
maiden of the maiden city, than some later
St John, continuing his fulminations from
Patmos, judging all nations and condemning
them. It is only in rare moments that he can
speak a tender language as he does of the
Florence of an earlier day, standing in peace,
sober, chaste, with no houses void of a family;
with her nobles in leather jerkins, and their
ladies at the cradle, or the distaff, telling their
handmaidens the tales of Troy, and Rome, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>Fiesole. Such is the manner of poets: to
praise times past in preference to the present,
and usually without reason. A little later,
you will hear Peter condemning his successors,
who imitate him in that calling which he
followed before he followed the call of Christ,
rather than in his later life:</p>

<p class='c000'>Everything in the poem is a condemnation of
this world. A sense of complete isolation
has overcome the writer. He stands alone,
neither Guelf nor Ghibelline, but a party to
himself: the first Italian."</p>

<p class='c000'>He paused, drank a little wine, and smiled
tolerantly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I, too, began life in attaching myself to a
party; and when my party was expulsed I
became a Florentine, and now, having considered
all the cities of Italy, I am an Italian.
But the great mass of my countrymen are
still as Dante saw them, split up into numerous
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>factions, weak by divisions, a ready prey to
any comer."</p>

<p class='c000'>Cromwell stroked his chin meditatively and,
discreet, said nothing.</p>

<p class='c000'>"When our dreams have faded, Messer,"
continued the other, "we can only sit aloof,
watching the comedy of life with at best a
tolerant contempt, but more often hiding,
under a mask of cynicism and sarcasm, the
maimed heart that is in us."</p>

<p class='c000'>The other was a little embarrassed, after a
moment he spoke quickly.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It seems, to my mind, Messer, that Dante's
poem hath no progress, no dramatic progress;
beyond the pedestrian interest of the scenes
described there is no motion."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Thought can be dramatic as well as
action," replied the other; "but I am inclined
to agree with you. Consider the poem as a
whole system of thought starting from 'the
master of those who know' and ending in
the beatific vision; consider it, next, as a
denunciation of all the lusts and depravity of
the world, typified, and made incarnate in
historical characters: Francesca, voyaging for
ever through the dusky air, on a wind that
seems to symbolise her own passion; Ugolino,
turning his strong teeth upon that wretched
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>skull: consider, finally, the little illuminations
which have made me compare the poem to a
missal or a book of hours; the terse phrase, the
very simplicity of which bites like an acid, so
keen it is. Then, I think, you will see how
various was his mind. His poem is like a
great life; his words like actions, sometimes
terrible and inhuman, sometimes like a
mother's tenderness with her child."</p>

<p class='c000'>Cromwell suddenly broke into a smile.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, yes, as you say, Messer, it is a whole
system of thought. Nay, even more, it is the
whole structure of a past age. But how
simple! How childish! The people of that
time seem to me like a few men gathered
together at night round an open fire; at hand
is a cheerful warmth, and light, but a few
paces away is the darkness full of terrors, and
on the borders of darkness are monstrous
shadows. They sit crouched about the fire,
telling idle tales to beguile their fears, thinking
that beyond that little glow of radiance is
nothing, whereas, at no great distance from
them is such another company round another
fire. We have explored the darkness, and
now the dawn is beginning."</p>

<p class='c000'>"<i>Magnus nascitur ordo</i>," said Machiavelli,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>smiling. "How many ages have said the
same thing?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"But it is here. The new order is born.
I am no scholar, Messer, but I have heard
Dean Colet and Erasmus. The recovery of
the Greeks hath let knowledge like a light
into many dark places; the whole political
fabric is dissolving, and flowing away into
the limbo of dead conceptions. The secular
power, which Dante wished, and which you
wish, to see established, is here."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes, it is here," answered Machiavelli;
"but what is it going to do? Mankind is
constantly labouring at an unknown task;
and, in seeking to be free, doth often but rivet
its own fetters more securely."</p>

<p class='c000'>"What do you mean?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Take as an example the conflict between
the senate and people of Rome. Marius
having been made the champion of liberty is
followed by Sulla the master of reaction; the
fight is long, bitter, and when finally the
people triumph they find themselves under
the absolute rule of one man. Now this
results from the fact that men worship the
name of freedom, rather than the thing itself;
those who fight in the cause of liberty are
fighting for their own establishment in power
<span class='pageno' id='Page_230'>230</span>and, being established, they seek to protect
themselves, and fortify their position as the
central authority; and, having been raised up
by the popular voice, they are stronger than
the power which they have supplanted; thus
it happens that the people warring against
their government in the cause of liberty do
but increase the power which they have aimed
to destroy. The present struggle is to rid
the State of the interference of the Church:
to found greater States. The popes have
destroyed Italy by playing off faction against
faction, and city against city, in the hope that
by this method they might become supreme
over all; but having introduced disorder into
every town, and destroyed all civic morality,
they have also lessened their own power; for
these states and cities were the Church's
bulwarks against the invader. Now, whatever
may be the issue of present affairs, the
Pope must become subject either to the
Emperor or to the King of France. This is
the nemesis of their policy. The liberty of the
State will be achieved, at least in a great
measure; but the State being stronger will be
more absolute, more tyrannous. The solvent
of the new learning, as you call it, will be
smiled upon by kings, so long as it doth help
<span class='pageno' id='Page_231'>231</span>them to rid themselves of the Pope; but it
will be repressed the moment that it shows
any desire to alter or limit the power of the
States."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes," answered Cromwell; "but if they
once let in the flood, it will be too late to
think of building a dam."</p>

<p class='c000'>"When I was a young man I remember to
have heard Politian," said Machiavelli. "But
I think that the enthusiasm which began with
Petrarch, and continued into my younger days,
has died down. It is true that our studies
are better organised: we have the academies;
but learning in Italy at the present day is
rather a polite accomplishment than a serious
business. It hath not penetrated the mass of
people. To them, the two bases of the social
order are still the Pope and the Emperor, as
in Dante's day; and they condemn the new
learning as tending to overthrow these bases,
and so destroy the whole fabric of society.
The monks point to Erasmus as the cause of
the present troubles in Germany."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Erasmus doth seem to me to be the one
wise man," answered Cromwell. "He steereth
a middle course, condemning the fanatics on
both sides. It is his wish to avoid any
tumult, and merely to further the growth of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_232'>232</span>light and reason; for he is persuaded the
whole evil of the time comes from ignorance.
Colet, such another man, was persecuted with
accusations of heresy, so that he thought well
to withdraw himself from the public eye.
But neither of these men desired to overthrow
the Papacy or to promote a schism; for they
thought, if I remember aright, that such
methods, with their incidental violence, would
only prejudice the cause they had at heart;
their aim was to act upon the Church from
within, to reform its abuses, to root out this
pestilent brood of monks, and to promote a
healthy growth of lay opinion. To Erasmus
the German schismatics are no whit less
ignorant or less intolerant than his old enemies
the monks, and equally entangled in the webs
of vain theological sophistries. He believes
that the great influences are secret, and of
slow growth, gradually penetrating all things;
and he seeketh to form a party of intellectual
men, who shall work within reasonable limits,
acting as a new leaven to leaven the whole
lump."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have little faith in such an influence,
except as a preparation for the combat," said
Machiavelli. "What I praise in Erasmus is
that clearness of judgment, which insists that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_233'>233</span>the Bible should be read as any other book,
that each man should go direct to the source,
and fill his own vessel; for by that means
they will recognise the chicanery, which
isolates texts and phrases, and distorts their
sense. But not by any gentle methods will
the regeneration of Europe come to pass.
There is a stir, a commotion of minds, abroad,
which is testing the pretensions of the Church,
and rejecting them one by one. The sands
are shifting beneath the foundations of a
structure we thought builded upon a rock; and
though as yet the fabric stands, it showeth
great rents. So: the Pope and Emperor
remain to the majority the bases of the social
order, as I have said, and soon it will be
perceived by all men that the humanists, in
playing with questions of grammar, have
trenched upon matters of faith: a crime not
serious in itself, but exceedingly grave when
after reflection we learn that it compromises
temporalities. Men have not yet clearly seen
this danger, though a few, perhaps, have
suspected it. And, when the reaction against
humanism sets in, upon what arm will the
humanists rely to defend them?</p>

<p class='c000'>"They will by that time have created not
only a large following, but a temper among
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>the people. I myself, Messer, have great
hopes of our young King of England, who
hath grown under the influence of men similar
to Erasmus. He hath a royal nature, a
dominant will, a power not only of making
his people's aspirations his own, but that
supreme gift in a ruler which can make what
is to his own private advantage seem a matter
tending to further the public good. Though
as yet he be not fully tried, this much I will
venture to prophesy of him, that no hindrances
in the path he chooses will prevent him, and
that no man in his realm of England who fails
him once will fail him again."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You are either very fortunate, or very
unfortunate, to have such a prince," said
Machiavelli, with a smile. "But humanism
is of recent growth in your country.  It must
be followed by reform. And, if your King
hath that quality of true kingliness, which
maketh the aspirations of his people his own,
would he withstand reaction?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I cannot conceive that one of his nurture
and character should be found on any side
but that of reform."</p>

<p class='c000'>A light, incredulous smile played upon the
other's face.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It might be politic," he suggested.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>But Cromwell protruded his under-lip
obstinately.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I cannot conceive the possibility," he said.</p>

<p class='c000'>Machiavelli shrugged his shoulders, leaned
back in his chair, and looked at his guest over
joined finger-tips.</p>

<p class='c000'>"He hath written against Luther, but rather
for the reasons of Erasmus than for those of
the monks," said Cromwell slowly. "It is
even conceivable that if he once take up the
business of reforming the Church in England,
he may be forced into a more extreme position;
I mean into a denial of the Pope's
authority, and a position similar to that of the
followers of Luther. In that case, I admit,
the war will be between two extreme parties;
but it would be difficult to say which he would
support, or how far he would be compelled
to go. Certain it is to me that he will ally
himself with whatever party is likely to serve
his own ends, and will not forsake them until
they have gained him what he requires. Then,
indeed, he may cast aside the tool, which he
hath blunted by use, and choose one keener;
yet, in reality, he would be but sacrificing the
show for the substance; and his vicegerent
will always be the man who discerns his will
and executes it. Thus, his policy will be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>consistent, though his ministers change; for
at times perhaps, since the people always
blame those who surround a prince as the
abusers of his confidence, he may find it
necessary for him to discard, or even to sacrifice
one, whose sole fault is in the thoroughness
with which he carries out the royal will, for
often in history we read of the sacrifice of
a minister in order to lull popular feeling.
Witness the example, which you yourself
give, in your treatise of <i>The Prince</i>; where
you show how Messer Remiro d'Orco, Cesare
Borgia having set him over Romagna, by the
sternness of his measures soon cleansed it of
evil-doers and reduced it to order, for which
his master, fearful lest the harshness of his
lieutenant should be attributed to himself,
rewarded him with axe and block, exposing
the severed head in the market-place of
Cesena. Thus, though he had himself commanded
the severities which his lieutenant
practised, he escaped the odium consequent
to them, and was hailed by the people as
their deliverer."</p>

<p class='c000'>They sat for a little time, silent, in the
gathering dusk.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Still," said Cromwell thoughtfully, "there
must be ways of avoiding the ingratitude of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_237'>237</span>a master: either by the minister imputing to
the King openly, and upon every possible
occasion, all actions, whether of good or evil;
or else by his fortifying himself with powerful
friendships, and seeking in every way to
gain the voice of popular favour, so that
becoming greater than his master he may
withstand him."</p>

<p class='c000'>Machiavelli shifted a little in his chair, and
the darkness hid an ironic smile.</p>

<p class='c006'>"The final <i>Vale</i>!"</p>

<p class='c000'>He spoke, and lay silent. The dim figures
in the crowded room seemed to slip away
from him, his mind ceased to grasp at earthly
realities, a thick darkness enveloping it and
them; but the frail, wasted body still clung
insatiably to life, and answered the phrases
of the litany with long quavering sobs. At
last it, too, resigned its hold on life. He
seemed to see again, for one brief moment,
the kneeling cardinals; and then to join some
great current of being which swept him away
beyond the consciousness of time and space.
Gradually another consciousness dawned on
him. Upon the golden brown clouds, which
seemed to limit his vision, there was projected
suddenly a huge grotesque figure; the shadow
of a being more or less similar to man.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_242'>242</span>"Is it a devil come to torment me?" he
wondered incredulously.</p>

<p class='c000'>As the shadow advanced it became smaller;
he noticed that it seemed to have talons.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is a devil."</p>

<p class='c000'>But even as he spoke the shadow melted
about him, and out of the golden mist came
a strange-looking man, with a large, ungainly
head, gray hair in rather long straight wisps,
and lively intelligent eyes of a clear blue.
The figure was absurd, gnome-like, with a
pear-shaped stomach. The finger-nails were
very long. The stranger bowed, smiling, as
he approached, and spoke in a pleasant voice.</p>

<p class='c000'>"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Monsieur, je suis charmé de vous voir.
Etes-vous, par hazard, de notre petite planète
terre?</span>"</p>

<p class='c000'>"I am Gioacchino Pecci," he answered.</p>

<p class='c000'>A livelier interest was apparent on the
other's face; the smile became ironical.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is curious," he said after a pause. "It
is curious that we should have reached the
same paradise. On earth, Your Holiness,
I was Ernest Renan."</p>

<p class='c000'>"But is this paradise?" said Leo uneasily.
"<span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Je n'ai jamais cru----</span>"</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is the paradise of the incredulous,"
answered Renan. "There are many paradises:
<span class='pageno' id='Page_243'>243</span>that state of being which on earth
was called hell is the paradise of those given
over to animal passions. The paradise of
the ascetics is an eternal Shrove Tuesday,
with the eternal prospect of an eternal Ash
Wednesday; the case of Tantalus reversed
and made pleasurable. All good Buddhists
have attained Nirvana. The righteous
Mahometan is distracted by the charms of
innumerable <i>houris</i>. We Epicureans enjoy
that moment which is eternity; and every
man is justified in his own eyes."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is charming," said Leo.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is more," said Renan; "it is rational.
How puerile is the mortal conception of
paradise! Man has imagined a place where
virtue is rewarded and vice punished. He
believes in it with a passionate conviction,
because he is not quite sure. He forgets that
virtue must be disinterested, or it ceases to
be virtue. If man is capable of a free and
unhampered choice between vice and virtue,
if the distinction between them be clear and
precise, and the reward or punishment entailed
by the choice definite and finally revealed,
mankind, then, is obviously divided into two
parts: the astute and the infatuate. One
feels immediately that both the reward and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>the punishment are excessive; or else that
vice and virtue have ceased to exist. However,
in mortal things there is always an
element of doubt, and perhaps the chief glory
of man is born from it. Our choice is not
entirely free, the distinction is not absolutely
clear, the reward is purely hypothetical."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah, M. Renan," said Leo, "why are
you here? You were always a believer at
heart; one might almost say a scholastic.
You invented a system of doubt, as others
might a system of faith; even your doubts
were affirmations. Science with you was only
a synonym for God, and round it you constructed
an hierarchy of saints and martyrs,
a church suffering, militant, triumphant.
Lucian----"</p>

<p class='c000'>"He is here," said Renan.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Lucian," continued Leo, "imagined the
soul of Plato inhabiting a paradise constructed
after the model of his own Republic.
I imagine you projected into that strange
future which you announced in your <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dialogues
Philosophiques</span></i>."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Doubt must be systematic," answered
Renan; "but there is no need for system
in religion. The essence of a creed is in its
assertions, not in its arguments. Its arguments
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>are nearly always a series of after-thoughts,
of apologies; its reason is always
<i>à priori</i>; the very fact that an argument should
be considered necessary is blasphemous and
heretical. You exaggerate my scholasticism;
but there was always in me the nature of a
priest, and I could not put away from me
my education, as I could put off my ecclesiastical
dress. I imported the unction of a
priest into the region of philosophic doubt,
and by that means invented a substitute for
faith. Science, in limiting the field of its
researches, has increased the mystery which
lies beyond. I became, as it were, the priest
of an unknown God; and the first article
of my creed was, that perhaps he did not
exist at all. 'Sois béni pour ton mystère,' I
cried in my <i>Magnificat</i>; 'béni pour t'être caché,
béni pour avoir reservé la pleine liberté de nos
cœurs.' The <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Dialogues Philosophiques</span></i> were
written at a time when the whole thought
of France was depressed and reactionary.
They were a play of intelligence upon contemporary
ideas. Progress does not tend to
establish a scientific aristocracy at the head
of its affairs; science is progressive because
it has saturated the commercial classes with
its ideals; it has increased production, and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>economised in by-products. This alliance
between democracy and the scientific spirit
is the unique characteristic of our age. I
think, myself, that society is tending to adopt
the Chinese model. Kingship, the State, the
present conventions of society, may continue
to exist in atrophied and rudimentary forms;
but I imagine the whole earth in a few
thousand years regulated by examinations
and trade-unions, with an effete mandarinate
surviving amid the débris of the ancient
order, like the solitary column of Phocas
in the Roman Forum, or the teeth in an
embryonic whale."</p>

<p class='c000'>"In this paradise," said Leo with an elusive
smile, "you have, doubtless, infinite leisure for
the discussion of these academic questions."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Naturally," answered Renan; "and we
have a little Academy modelled on the
Académie Française. I hope, Monsieur, to
have the honour of welcoming you among us,
and of replying to your <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">discours de réception</span></i>;
it is an amiable duty which my colleagues
have delegated to me. Sometimes; it is what
remains of my mortal vanity, Monsieur;
I imagine that I have some talent in these
things."</p>

<p class='c000'>Leo had intended to be ironical; but his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_247'>247</span>own vanity was now flattered. One ambition
is always left to those who occupy a throne;
it is to be considered equal with the great.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Your response, Monsieur, will be my
apotheosis," he replied. "But, tell me, are
you become a socialist? Your prophecy of
the reformation of the earth on the Chinese
model seems to point that way."</p>

<p class='c000'>Renan smiled.</p>

<p class='c000'>"No," he said; "the Chinese are not a
socialistic nation. They have not the notion
of the State which is peculiar to socialism.
But they are a nation governed by trades-unions
and examining boards; and through
the same institutions we may arrive at the
same stagnation. Our progress at present
seems to follow that direction, because the
aim of our materialistic civilisation is to make
everything cheap, food, education, state-offices;
and its final effect will be to make men cheap,
then we shall have large, flat, arid masses of
humanity, to whom few luxuries will be
possible, and the forms of our civilisation
will become stereotyped. As it was with
Babylon, Assyria, and Egypt, as it is with
China, so it will be with us. Evolution is
the progress from homogeneity to heterogeneity;
but the process is not indefinite.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_248'>248</span>"After a race or a nation has produced a
great number of diverse personalities, it becomes
decadent and tends to produce a single type:
the process of evolution is arrested, and the
race may either lie dormant for centuries
if like the Chinese it has been prolific and
exists in sufficient numbers; or, if sparse
and scattered like the Phœnicians, they may
be completely annihilated by their more
vigorous neighbours. Socialism is neither a
remedy nor a disease, but it may be a
symptom. No society has been free from
socialistic groups. Jerusalem had its <i>ebionim</i>;
there was the eclectic philosophy of Rome
under Nero, the Flavians, and the Antonines;
primitive Christianity was communistic, and
Neo-Christianity under Joachim of Flora and
St Francis was an imitation of it. The
Jacobins had communistic notions. The poor,
the humble, the oppressed have always been
liable to the dreams of millenarism; and the
difference between the Maccabean aspiration,
which was, according to Daniel, to establish
the kingdom of God upon earth, and the
aspiration of Robespierre, who wished 'to
found upon earth the empire of wisdom, of
justice, and of virtue,' is merely the difference
of time and place. A beautiful, but intangible
<span class='pageno' id='Page_249'>249</span>vision; a divine inspiration! Like all divine
inspirations, alas! it is by its nature impracticable.
Imagine a sudden uprising of the proletariate,
a vast social movement, an European
revolution. Slowly, after its momentary chaos,
a new cohesion would take effect. The
abstract virtues, from which the movement
had had its derivation, would become personified
in our most popular legislators; the new
constitution would include, beside the disadvantages
of an untried mechanism, many
errors latent in the old patterns which it would
necessarily follow; and we should discover,
after a series of futile and extravagant adventures,
that the laws which govern society are
essentially natural laws, the slow growth of tacit
acceptance, and not merely the dusty records
of a popular legislating assembly. Mankind
does not learn the lesson easily. One revolution
engenders another, and eventually the
habit becomes ingrained. The history of mine
own country, from 1789 through the nineteenth
century, a history of revolution, of the conflict
between ideals and realities, is a signal and a
reminder to the nations."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You treat Christianity and Jacobinism as
cognate ideas," said Leo, after a pause.
"There is surely this distinction between
<span class='pageno' id='Page_250'>250</span>them, that one was almost entirely religious,
and the other almost entirely political."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah," said Renan, with a deprecating
smile, "all religions are political, just as
all politics are religious. Christianity with
its notion of mankind as a brotherhood, and
the Papacy with its notions of a spiritual
empire, a suzerainty, over all peoples, have
destroyed the ancient conception of the unity
of Church and State. The religion of the
Greeks was embodied in their laws; and the
politics of the Jews, in their religion. The
ideal conception of religion as something
quite distinct from the State has proved unworkable,
if not disastrous. All the churches
have had to smite their mystics with the
thunders of excommunication, to extinguish
the inward light, to restrain the free play of
thought. Even the most primitive form of
Christianity, the Messianic notion, was purely
political. If we are to talk on social questions
we cannot separate religion from politics.
The distinction between them is artificial;
they are merely the opposite poles of a single
idea."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah, well!" said Leo, shrugging his
shoulders; "the progress of humanity is a
chimæra if it ends merely in stagnation.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_251'>251</span>These bleak, arid masses of mankind living
without pleasures in their Chinese frugality,
what future have they before them?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"An awakening," said Renan prophetically;
"the Kings of Uruk reigning over a decadent
civilisation, Sardanapalus foreseeing the stagnation
of his people did not dream of a future
which they had helped to create. The process
of evolution acts in tides; there is a continuous
ebb and flow; the seed lies hidden
in the ground until the wizardry of Spring
calls it forth, and rain and sunlight nourishing
it into new life, it ripens for the harvest.
Babylon the great is fallen, is fallen. In
the ruined palaces of Nineveh the beasts of
the desert bring forth their young, and the
green lizards creep out from the crevices to
sun themselves upon a fragment of some
boastful inscription; but the music which
echoed in its painted halls, the dancing and
the choirs, the great processions of its Kings,
its wisdom and folly, its vain desires and
failures, its tears and laughter, these have
their being still, they move mysteriously in
us, a breath would quicken them into life
again, we can rebuild them in moments that
seem to have all the profundity of time."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Poet!" said Leo, with a smile creasing
<span class='pageno' id='Page_252'>252</span>about his lean jaws. "The world does not
become socialist, it becomes Chinese; our
civilisation tends to a variety of forms, becomes
uniform, and then again becomes diverse in
endless recurrence. Continue, Monsieur, but
let us keep within the bounds of our own
age. Socialism is a definite political force; and
even if it do not triumph completely it must
create certain new conditions. I, myself, have
condemned socialism in one of my encyclicals.
I have denied the sacred right of insurrection.
Human institutions, which we may think have
survived their usefulness, are in reality only
waiting for their transformation, their character
is moulded from outside. We may sometimes
fail to understand their mission, or to grasp
the reasons which impel them to follow certain
paths, because these reasons are pale reflections
of some unappreciated causes. The world
seems to progress, within the limits of natural
laws, by a series of unforeseen developments.
The future is latent in us; but the force which
impels it is hidden."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Yes," answered Renan; "some internal
conscience directs all progress, and is the force
which impels humanity on its way. This
conscience has a secret action long before it
finds a voice. Its influence at first is something
<span class='pageno' id='Page_253'>253</span>subterranean and obscure; its bias is
necessarily against the official creeds, but it
moves against them slowly, informing them
with the new spirit. I like to find this
conscience acting through the poorer and
humbler classes of the people, the folk who are
of the soil, whose faith is something native and
spontaneous, whose life and happiness depends
upon the sun and rain. It is significant that
all the gods were originally agricultural gods,
that the history of every nation begins in Eden.
To the artisan, the dweller in towns, whose
whole life consists in turning out from a
machine certain articles of a stereotyped
pattern, the universe is simply a piece of
mechanism; he is himself merely a machine,
or part of a machine, performing a certain
number of invariable motions to produce a
definite and invariable result. He lacks
inspiration, he has no vivid knowledge of the
great element of chance which moves, like one
of those primitive elemental gods, behind all
human affairs, at times compassionate and
friendly to man, at times bursting out into
a sudden fury of wanton destruction. He
demands a fixed wage, fixed hours of work,
fixed prices for the commodities which he consumes,
the certainty of a pension in his old
<span class='pageno' id='Page_254'>254</span>age. In a world of fluctuations and vicissitudes
he demands absolute security. He is
confident that he is going to do great things,
that he has already worked wonders. With
the aid of science and art, which he starves, he
is going to make the earth pleasant and
beautiful. He is quite confident that in a few
generations he will be born in an incubator,
and die, without pain, of sheer satiety. For
him a fantastic assembly of politicians, removable
at his own will, represents Providence
and the divine wisdom. Is he less
absurd than the savages who employ rain-makers
and witch doctors? I do not think so.
Clearly he is not a person from whom we can
expect any but the most crude and mechanical
readings of life; his vague, restless, childish
discontent, that hunger for barren and tawdry
pleasures which is characteristic of half-educated
minds, that lack of intercourse with
the great elemental forces of Nature, can issue
in nothing but his own mental, moral, and
physical damnation.</p>

<p class='c000'>"For any new readings of life, for any
renaissance of art and religion, we must look
to the simple folk, who are still close to the
breasts of Earth: the folk who of old imagined
Apollo as a herd in the service of Admetus;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_255'>255</span>who found Demeter sitting by the well, and
comforted her; who, after the vintage had
been gathered in, took down the grotesque
masks, which they had hung upon the vines to
scare the birds and foxes from the grapes, and
acted in them, singing the hymns of Dionysos
to the music of pipes and flutes. Poetry,
religion, love, the three things which quicken
life to new effort, are never far from the soil.
The great conventional middle-classes, even
those heretics from Philistia, the followers of
Comte and Marx, the mediocre intelligences
whose political principles are communist, and
whose religious principles are positivist, these
have little influence on the future. Socialism
differs from all previous Utopian dreams simply
because it lacks their vital energy; it is
material and mechanical where the older ideas
were spiritual and natural; it is lacking in
a sense of morality, in a sense of beauty, in a
sense of truth. You will not find the conscience
of humanity in any of these creeds."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It seems," said Leo, "that we do not know
where we are going."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You have said that human institutions
are only waiting for their transformation,"
Renan replied. "An institution represents a
need. It has been formed by the spontaneous
action of the community; but the moment it
<span class='pageno' id='Page_256'>256</span>has been thus constituted it becomes fixed,
and ceases to represent the living, developing
forces which deposited it. Christianity at first
was perfectly fluid; the teaching of Paul
was unsystematic, local, momentary; but
Christianity became a religion, not of inspiration
but of authority, it crystallised into an
hierarchy and perished. In the same way
the idyll of St Francis and his companions
crystallised into an order, and perished. They
exist among us as monuments, these institutions;
but the same forces which crystallised
them are now dissolving them; the moment
they cut themselves off from the stream
of life they perished. I do not think that
the future will differ essentially from the
past. Socialism is simply the cry of the
poor against the rich. Dives is well-clad and
fares sumptuously every day; no other crime
is alleged against him, but these are sufficient
to ensure his damnation. Perhaps the maker
of the parable saw some peculiar virtue in
poverty and suffering, which filled the heart
with a spiritual grace, and uplifted it with
moral fortitude. Perhaps he saw the wealth
of Dives as poverty, as a lack of spiritual
experience.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Socialism, however, does not share this
<span class='pageno' id='Page_257'>257</span>view; on the contrary, it asserts that wealth
is the sole condition of spiritual grace and
moral fortitude, and it is therefore bent on
sharing with Dives the good things of this
world. Consequently socialism has against
it the two most deeply-rooted of human
instincts, the instinct of acquisition and the
family instinct; because it denies the right
of possession and the right of bequest. How
deeply-rooted the notion of property is we
can see exemplified in France, where the
abolition of the right of primogeniture has
not had the effect which was expected of it,
even the peasants in certain departments
having held out against it. But if the power
of bequest were entirely abolished, would
people marry? The object for a legalised
relation is gone, and the production of our
kind becomes subject to the hazard of personal
choice. It is possible that the State would
have to intervene and make maternity an
honourable profession under its own control,
and that Plato's ideal of the State as a foster-mother
would be realised. This notion has,
I confess, a singular attraction for me. The
substitution of a stock derived from careful
selection of parents for our present inferior
stock; the careful breeding of an aristocratic
<span class='pageno' id='Page_258'>258</span>caste, appeals to the imagination, as it shows
the State actually realising what has always
been its ideal.</p>

<p class='c000'>"I could wish, Monsieur, that the socialists
would form themselves into monastic communities,
practising the virtues of obedience
and, if not poverty, the community of goods.
Yes; they should found a little Abbey of
Theleme, and take their whole rule from
Rabelais. They would not practise celibacy,
but eugenics; and the education of their
children would be the same as that devised
for Gargantua by Ponocrates. So they
would increase and multiply, and the whole
earth would be filled with the glory of
their names. I fear that, unfortunately, the
first verse of what was written above the
gate of Theleme would debar many from
entering. But grant that this Utopia is
possible; it is surely no less possible than the
monastic ideal! And granted that a great
aristocratic caste would arise, a dedicated folk,
surrounded by the decadent populations of
helots and hetairai, and that they would be
able to gather into their own hands the
supreme control of things? what would be
the result? They would crystallise into an
hierarchy, and perish. They would rule as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_259'>259</span>the priests ruled Egypt, and as the priests
ruled mediæval Europe. They would resuscitate
the double tyranny of the Church and
State in one body. The whole progress of
the last four hundred years has been toward
individual liberty in thought and word. That
ideal would be lost."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I do not see the necessity of such ideals,"
said Leo. "I object to socialism because it
would mean the absolute tyranny of the State,
the despotism of a narrow and intolerant
bureaucracy, tempered, as at present in Russia,
by a more or less indiscriminate system of
assassination. I have not the same objection
to the tyranny of one man. A philosopher
on the throne, Monsieur, your charming
Marcus Aurelius for instance, may rule with
wisdom and moderation; but an oligarchy
of philosophers, like the Thirty at Athens:
hell is naked before them and destruction
hath no covering! Such experiments, as you
say, infect the people with a lust for revolution.
History, the only guide for political
prophets, shows us that sudden disturbance of
the social order breeds a whole series, whether
such a disturbance occur among the ancient
Greeks, or the Romans, or the French. The
diverse natures of the peoples, the different
<span class='pageno' id='Page_260'>260</span>conditions of the age in which they lived, and
of their political methods do not alter the
central fact. Humanity in the lump is a
beast more terrible than any in Revelations."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah, no!" cried Renan, with a sudden
vivacity. "There is the chief glory of the
human race. They will sacrifice themselves
for an impossible ideal. None of us can
contemplate that great tragedy of the French
Revolution without feeling cleansed by it.
The enthusiasm of the people has a kind of
terrible grandeur. In such moments of divine
delirium all men assume heroic proportions.
We may pity it for its fanaticism; we may
pity it for being so easily duped; but it is
impossible to deny its magnificent devotion to
an ideal."</p>

<p class='c000'>Leo was unmoved.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You consider it a great moral movement,
Monsieur?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Moral because all petty egoisms were
obliterated," answered Renan. "Men seemed
for a moment to become the incarnations of
ideas. Oh, on both sides. Charlotte Corday,
Danton, Madame Roland, Robespierre, Desmoulins,
Larochejacquelin; each individuality
seems to have had its definite mission, each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_261'>261</span>seems to have been equally necessary, equally
an instrument of justice."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You have said, Monsieur," continued Leo,
after a pause, "that the socialists would
revive in one form the twin tyrannies of
Church and State, and destroy the ideal of
individual liberty. You have also said that
the ancient conception of Church and State
was a unity. Would the kind of socialism
which you sketch resemble the Greek State?"</p>

<p class='c000'>"No ancient State, not even Athens, extended
to its citizens the liberty which we
enjoy," answered Renan. "The State intervened
in the private affairs of the citizens; and
Athens is notorious for having pursued the
philosophers with accusations of impiety. The
noble conservative families and the priesthood
combined to stifle the new liberal thought.
The State, however, was democratic; the
people ruled, decided by their votes the
policy of the State, and served on juries, or as
judges. Socialism condemns democracy: it
aspires to govern not by the will of the people,
but according to its own interpretation of
what it calls scientific principles; and it seems
that in its application of these principles, it
would be more bigoted and intolerant than
the democratic State in Greece ever was."</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_262'>262</span>"Nothing then is permanent, which crystallises
into an hierarchy, or is limited by an
institution," said Leo. "It seems to me that
your gospel is purely destructive. The whole
progress of modern science is marked by the
ruins of ancient altars; you have freed mankind
from all moral obligations in denying
that he is a responsible agent, and in showing
that he is merely a creature of inherited
instincts; you have shown him that his life is
no more than a ripple on the water, a sudden
stir of wind in the leaves, a momentary light in
the darkness; you have denied the God that
his heart fashioned as a solace to his grief, a
lamp to guide him; you have taught him to
seek for the perishable glories of the earth.
How will you make him a moral being again?"</p>

<p class='c000'>Renan smiled.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Our civilisation is not very deep, Monsieur,"
he said. "There is always a large
inert mass of humanity untouched by the
movement of thought. From them we may
expect a new religion, a new morality. We
have denied and disproved, as you say, so
many things, that at last we shall come to
the sole reality. We have rendered man's
personality vague and mysterious, until it
seems scarcely to exist except as a point of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_263'>263</span>development; we must seek deeper for his
reality. And in any case, Monsieur, you overrate
the value of reason. In my charming
walk through life I had sufficient experience
to learn that man is not entirely a creature
of reason. There are few people without a
conscience. The fault of this age is not so
much that it is scientific, as that it is
mechanical and removed from the contemplation
of Nature."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have sometimes thought," said Leo,
"that the principal hope for religion lies in
the fact that the lower classes do not think."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is true," said Renan; "religion is some
hidden consciousness working toward unknown
ends. Mankind is not entirely reasonable; it
has a conscience. We can no more say that
this conscience is an artificial product of
society, than we can say that reason is an
artificial product also. The curiosity which
is so amusing a feature of the intelligence of
cats and monkeys is an earlier stage of the
scientific curiosity; and, on the other hand,
animals have shown gratitude to their masters,
and thus the rudiments of virtue. Man, in
recognising his conscience, has developed the
abstract virtues of justice, of pity, of unselfishness;
it does not affect the main question that
<span class='pageno' id='Page_264'>264</span>his choice between virtue and vice should
not be entirely free, nor that the distinction
between them should not be always clear.
We do not reproach science because it has not
yet shown us what course our sun and its
train of planets are taking in their journey
toward a star in Hercules, nor because it has
been unable, by its study of the rapidity and
direction of other solar systems, to give to
them an approximate fixity in connection with
ourselves, to draw what would really be a
map of the heavens.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh, Monsieur, man is a naturally moral
being, just as he is a naturally curious and
scientific being. To him both curiosity and
morality are natural needs, and because they
are needs they are truths. It is impossible
to consider a world which does not act according
to a law of virtue, just as it is impossible
to consider a world which does not act in
accordance with the law of gravitation, or,
better still, as an example, a species which
has not developed in accordance with the
law of evolution; and just as the scientist
finds behind all the fleeting appearances and
phenomena of the world a basis in matter,
so, behind all the phenomena and fleeting
appearances of virtue we find a basis in God,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_265'>265</span>And just as an individual is governed by
his conscience in regulating his actions, so
humanity as a whole regulates its actions by
an appeal to some abstract idea of right.
Such dramatic crises as the Revolution, and
the establishment of the Roman Empire, seem
equally the result of a certain slow consciousness
working toward perfection; or take the
growth of Christianity, which began obscurely
and with a literally subterranean movement, is
it not an instance of this blind working toward
the light. One cannot outrage the collective
conscience of mankind with impunity. A
sudden outburst of popular resentment like
the Revolution, which had been incubating for
at least a century, cannot be considered as a
mere caprice; can, indeed, only be considered
as a revelation of justice. Such outbursts
have a purely negative effect upon human
progress; progress is the development of a
new spirit, not the destruction of an old
constitution."</p>

<p class='c000'>"You offer no constructive policy, beyond
the creation of a new spirit. Socialism, at
least, pretends to one."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Socialism is a reactionary force," answered
Renan; "and all reactions are bound to be
more constructive than a progressive force.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_266'>266</span>Their natural tendency, as I have already said,
is to crystallise in a definite form. The spirit
of progress is, on the contrary, an intangible
if all-pervading thing. It develops spontaneously
in a thousand ways, and as it pushes
towards the unknown it is impossible for us
to predict with any certainty what forms it
may assume. Being purely experience, and
not a creed, it is liable to be extensively
modified or even completely changed by some
unforeseen development in any of its parts; a
discovery in any branch of science may react
upon all, as the progress of palæontology
reacted upon history. That is the reason
progress seems always to be a purely destructive
force. It is only after it has escaped, through
imperceptible degrees, into a more or less
clearly defined new phase, that we can gauge
its value as a constructive force in the last."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I see with you, Monsieur, the value of
democracy and individual liberty," said Leo.
"Oh, I am reasonable. The character of a
pope is to be found less in the official acts of
his reign, than in the temper which he fosters
in the Church. The nature of his office compels
him to claim the privileges and exemptions
which his predecessors claimed. He resigns
nothing; but he allows some of his claims
<span class='pageno' id='Page_267'>267</span>to remain in abeyance, refusing to deprive
his successors of a power, which, either for
reasons of expediency, or through personal
dislike, he declines to exercise himself. I
came to the chair of Peter under disadvantageous
circumstances. The Papal States had
been lost, and in exchange the doctrine of a
vague empire over spiritual things had been
proclaimed. Infallibility was no new thing;
but the enunciation of it as an article of
faith crystallised a power which would have
been of more value, if it had been left indeterminate.
I won back much that Pius had
lost. I made no use of the instruments which
he had forged; I discouraged, rather than condemned,
the liberal movements within the
Church; my policy was one of insinuation,
and, by skilfully leaving certain positions undefended,
I gained that they should not be
assailed. Alas, Monsieur! you smile at this
panegyric of myself; but I have left no one
behind who would consider it an honourable
office to praise me. The encyclical on biblical
studies, and the biblical commission, were
perhaps my two mistakes. The glorification
of scholasticism was perhaps a mistake; but
I rather think it diverted the attention of my
flock. However these things may appear in
<span class='pageno' id='Page_268'>268</span>the eyes of the world, my reign was wise,
temperate, and resulted in a great increase
of power. I recognised democracy and republican
principles. I attempted to win the
people. I was defeated by the extremists on
mine own side."</p>

<p class='c000'>"An epitaph, Monsieur, not only on yourself,
but on your office."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Perhaps," answered Leo. "We do not
know. The dead know so little of what is
taking place on Earth."</p>

<p class='c000'>"On the contrary," said Renan, "voyagers
from the Earth are constantly arriving, and
we are kept well advised."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I can imagine a moderately successful issue
to my policy if my successor should be a
man of tact. Even if institutions be only
the monuments of an idea, men must build
them; and, in spite of your argument, I think
a period of authority, at least of a more
correct balance between authority and liberty,
is setting in. I have still hoped for the papacy.
Comtism, some one said, was Catholicism with
Christianity left out. The qualifying clause
is perhaps unnecessary. Comtism, socialism,
internationalism, are all 'Catholic' ideas. To
the Church the name of a nation is merely a
geographical expression, it knows no frontiers,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_269'>269</span>no distinctions of race or language, it has no
preference for any form of government, being
superior to all. The Latin language is for it,
a universal tongue, which no sane person
could consider inferior to Volapuk or Esperanto.
The Church, properly constituted, might
draw into itself a great deal of this floating
idealism. We might approximate our ideals.
You would say, Monsieur, that we were all
equally reactionary."</p>

<p class='c000'>"All synthetic ideas are," said Renan.
"Anarchism is in its essence more truly progressive
than socialism, because it is for the
individual. Socialism implies either that all
men are made after the same pattern, that in
certain circumstances they will act in a
certain manner, or that external influences,
education, and environment, will turn out a
uniform model. It is an error. If education
were all-important, the Church would not
have lost ground consistently in Catholic
Europe, where the Jesuits have had practically
the whole of education in their hands for
two centuries. If such a machine as the
society has failed, though it was backed by
the State, and spoke with a quasi-spiritual
authority, one cannot imagine a State department
succeeding. Liberty is the condition
<span class='pageno' id='Page_270'>270</span>of development, and education develops, it
does not create."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is important, however, to control the
means of development," answered Leo. "Of
course our education would be modern."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Monsieur, you spoke of an encyclical on
biblical studies."</p>

<p class='c000'>Renan's voice was seductive; Leo made
a gesture of impatience.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It was a mistake," he said quickly. "At
certain moments the heads of any organisation
are liable to be driven into a false position
by their extreme supporters. My policy was
to let things take their course; to assimilate
what we could of the new spirit, and let the
rest die without noise. My condemnation of
Americanism was unobtrusive, and I did not
condemn the French Liberal priests who were
busy with biblical exegesis, because I saw that
attacks on dogma do not interest the mass
of people; nine Catholics out of ten do not
know what they believe in: and if your
methods of criticism, Monsieur Renan, had
not been advertised by so many fanatics, you
would have been read almost entirely for
the sake of your style. There is a little
man in France now, a little man with the
smile and features of Voltaire, whose criticism
<span class='pageno' id='Page_271'>271</span>has rendered the work of all those tedious
Germans, and your own, quite obsolete. Our
good Ultramontanes wished to persecute
him into popularity, and to advertise him
by excommunication. They told me he
was a heretic. Of course he was. All the
Fathers of the Church were heretics. St
Paul was a heretic. So was St Augustine.
So was St Francis. So were Lamennais,
Lacordaire, and Newman. But it is a pity
that the world should know it. St Paul's
heterodoxy laid the foundations of the
Church. St Augustine's heterodoxy, that
the sacred writings were not to be taken
literally, built it up. St Francis's heterodoxy
staved off the Reformation for three
centuries. Lamennais and Lacordaire in
France, Newman in England, infused new
life into our veins. Let us point to the
names of our sons and not to their works."</p>

<p class='c000'>A subtle enjoyment illuminated Renan's
face.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Monsieur, you were always an enigma
to me."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is simple," said Leo; "the impregnable
rock upon which we build is simply the
impregnable ignorance of the majority. Do
you think that science can alter or influence
<span class='pageno' id='Page_272'>272</span>the emotions of the plain man? It does not
touch him. He prefers to accept blindly a
creed which he does not understand in order
that he may devote himself to the business
and pleasures of life. He has no time to
pause, to question, to criticise, to select. He
aims at euthanasia. His doubts, such as he
has, are almost entirely subconscious; and for
the sake of his own peace of mind he will
attempt to stifle them if they lift their heads.
The number of men who can look on life,
the whole of life, with a tranquil mind is
extremely small; and even these have their
moments of failure, weakness, and spiritual
lassitude, moments in which life seems a
hideous nightmare, in which the individual,
grown morbidly conscious of his own being,
sees it as no more than an infinitesimal
point in the great waste of time and space,
the great darkness of eternity, wherein all
the worlds at present existing are no more
than a shower of sparks.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Man, that creature of incredible vanity and
innumerable petty egoisms, refuses to consider
for very long the melancholy spectacle of a
world hastening merely towards its death, and
carrying with it his whole store of spiritual
experience, of poems and philosophies, theologics
<span class='pageno' id='Page_273'>273</span>and sciences, which his forefathers have
created, and his descendants shall renew.
Therefore, when I considered the future of
religion as an indispensable condition of life,
and when I imagined further a kind of alliance
between the proletariate and mine own Church,
I based my calculations principally upon the
feet that the great majority of men do not
think; indeed, that they refuse to think.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Creeds may pass away, but the individuality
of man changes, if at all, only by imperceptible
degrees. Ages of faith and ages of scepticism
recur, and give place to each other, with almost
the same regularity as the ebb and flow of a
tide. The age of Pericles was sceptical,
the age of Cæsar was sceptical, the ages of
Leo X. and Louis XV. were sceptical; but
from age to age the peasant has sate by the
fire after his day's work, dreaming the same
dreams, and hearing nothing of the world's
doubt. He is much the same kind of pagan
as he always was. He has seized upon, in a
way we cannot understand, the primitive,
elementary conditions, which subsist in all
religions. You were right, Monsieur, in
tracing religion to him. He is its source.
Perhaps he has never accepted Christianity;
but Christianity has accepted him. Laborious,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_274'>274</span>innocent, stupid, scarcely more human than
the cattle, who are literally his foster-brothers,
he looks out upon his little world with patient
eyes, wondering; and he brings us the fruits
of the earth and the bread of life."</p>

<p class='c000'>"I have said with Voltaire," murmured
Renan, "that if a God did not exist we
should have to invent one."</p>

<p class='c000'>Once again a deep, ironic smile creased
about Leo's jaws.</p>

<p class='c000'>"You were perhaps right, Monsieur," he
said; "but we should prefer not to tax your
ingenuity. The gods invented by science
are always afar off; or they sleep, perchance;
or they are concerned with their own affairs;
in any case they do not hear us when we call
to them. I consider our Church capable of
a larger growth if it will only remain silent
on the question of dogma, which should be
left like seed to grow and quicken in the
earth. Time will obtain for any dogma a
certain measure of tacit acceptance, because
truth to the majority is merely something
which has been said over and over again.
Besides the psychological basis of my calculations,
the fact that the majority do not think,
there is the political basis. This has entered
into a new phase. In the Middle Ages the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_275'>275</span>Church was allied with the State against the
people. Its dogmas were enforced by the
secular arm. Innocent III. was a kind of
suzerain over the princes of Europe. But
even here, already, the Church knew upon
occasion to ally herself with the people, and
threaten a king through his own subjects, by
releasing a nation from its allegiance, and
troubling its internal peace by an interdict.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Since my predecessor, the Church has
definitely adopted this policy; but with a
more subtile and insinuating method. Infallibility
relates not only to matters of dogma,
but to matters of State, <i>quoad mores</i> as well as
<i>quoad fidem</i>. You will remember, Monsieur,
that Antonelli addressed a despatch to the
Nuncio at Paris, in which he says: 'The
Church has never intended, nor now intends,
to exercise any direct and absolute power
over the political rights of the State. Having
received from God the lofty mission of guiding
men, whether individually or as congregated
in society, to a supernatural end, she has by
that very fact the authority and the duty to
judge concerning the morality and justice of
all acts, internal and external, in relation to
their conformity with the natural and divine
law. And as no action, whether it be
<span class='pageno' id='Page_276'>276</span>ordained by a supreme power, or be freely
elicited by an individual, can be exempt from
this character of morality and justice, it so
happens that the judgment of the Church,
though falling directly on the moral of the
acts, indirectly reaches over everything with
which that morality is conjoined. But this
is not the same thing as to interfere directly
in political affairs.' That direct interference
we must avoid."</p>

<p class='c000'>Renan seemed to hesitate before he spoke.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It may be," he answered, "as you say,
that mankind does not progress, but merely
revolves. Sometimes I have thought so. But
nothing is repeated in precisely the same way.
Neither an individual, nor a society, is what
it imagines itself to be, in its action upon the
world. The Church, as it is considered by its
adherents, is something totally different from
the Church as it seems to its directors. Every
individual, and every age, examines the gospels
in a different light and from a different standpoint,
just as they examine the movement of
the planets, the structure of the earth, the
conception of kingship, of the State, even of
that most immediate object the body. The
life of St Francis seems to spring quite
naturally out of the mediæval world, with its
<span class='pageno' id='Page_277'>277</span>crude cosmogony, its notion of the universe as a
huge mechanical toy in the hands of God. To
such people the story of Joshua commanding
the sun was not childish; miracles quite as
wonderful were part of their daily lives; and
the world for them acted not according to
fixed immutable laws, but by the direct interposition
of a Providence susceptible to the
prayers of man. To us it is different. We
cannot imagine a St Francis appearing in
the modern world. The Church, Your Holiness,
cannot control the new movement,
which will either transform or destroy it; but
in what will you suffer it to be transformed?</p>

<p class='c000'>"The evil of infallibility is that it cannot
retract, or confess to error. The Pope has
been endowed with this fatal gift of infallibility,
a personal charisma, and through it he has
become an incarnation of the Divine Wisdom,
even as the Dalai Lama becomes an incarnation
of the Buddha. To the historian, the
heretical Pope Honorius, condemned equally
by Councils, and by his successors, is sufficient
to disprove your claims. But the Church can
triumph over facts of history. What it cannot
triumph over is the spirit of the age. You
have a large body of adherents, who describe
themselves as Catholic without knowing what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_278'>278</span>the term implies. You have a smaller, body,
whose principal business in life seems to lie
in reconciling, by innumerable sophistries and
subterfuges, your dogmas with the modern
world. The smallest body of all is made up
of those of your adherents, who accept you as
the sole fount of truth. But in each of these
three sections there is not a solitary individual
who accepts your teaching without colouring
it with his own ideas. Each will explain a
dogma from the point of view of his own
prejudices, and only accepts it with a kind of
mental reservation. Of course it always has
been so. Your peril lies in the rapid exchange
of ideas which characterises modern life, the
ease of communication, and the lack of
any effective machinery for preventing their
diffusion. The moment any crisis arises you
cease to act as a solid body; and the action
of your leaders has far less influence upon
public opinion than the action of your laity
excusing, or justifying, or explaining, the
multitudinous diversities which exist among
you. If this lay action be not public, it is
the more insidious. I have noticed that when
any important pronouncement is published
from the chair of Peter, your lay apologists
make no sign. There is an ominous silence.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_279'>279</span>All are disenchanted. All are suspect. They
seem to turn away, silent and troubled,
from what they imagined to be the ultimate
authority, and seek for their justification at
the tribunal of their private conscience."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Oh!" interrupted Leo brusquely, "I for
one do not regret that these gentlemen should
be made uncomfortable. A lay theologian
has no adequate reason for existing. It is
altogether undesirable that laymen, mere
amateurs, should concern themselves with
these things."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Eh bien!" said Renan. "It is entirely
owing to the laity that a certain type of
converts accrues to your ranks. Liberal
Catholicism, though you and I know what a
vain, chimerical, and ridiculous thing it is, is,
as it were, the first step. Take Newman's
theory of 'development' as an example.
Newman is the prophet dearest to the heart
of laymen; because, in a sense, his works are
popular. The Anglican may read him as a
classic, and, while enchanted with the magic
of that exquisite prose, lays himself open to
the attacks of a peculiarly subtile and insidious
mind. A certain temper is created in him.
He becomes receptive of Catholic ideas, and
one watches him progressing more or less
<span class='pageno' id='Page_280'>280</span>unconsciously toward Rome, blind to his
master's casuistry by reason of the ineffable
charm. He is like one implected with a
morbid craving for some narcotic drug, gradually
increasing the dose as its effect lessens.
Liberal Catholics are the lures for such. Your
Holiness had good reason for saying that
the Church had been founded by successive
heresies. The first step to a conversion is
always a misunderstanding."</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is perfectly true," said Leo; "but
Liberal Catholicism is finished. Only Newman's
hat protects him from censure. The
doctrine of development ceased to have any
value after the definition of infallibility. It
was valuable as leading up to the definition,
but afterwards it became an excuse for the
introduction of novelties. Its sole value now
is as a proselytising medium. But, Monsieur,
why do we continue? The Church is dissolving;
even Christianity itself seems to be
dissolving, to take on a fluid, personal form.
That singular body, the Society of Friends,
alone seems to be untouched by the solvent
of criticism. It has nothing upon which the
solvent may act, no dogmas, no sacraments,
no depository of tradition, no hierarchical
organisation. It recognises only the inward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_281'>281</span>spirit, that informing and subtile essence
which alone seems capable of interpreting
the righteousness of God, a religion of silence,
and of sudden illumination, a religion of
patient hope, of resignation, of a tacit understanding."</p>

<p class='c000'>"Ah," said Renan, smiling, "a religion
without forms, without enthusiasms, is scarcely
one to satisfy all men. It is fascinating to
consider the future of Christianity. After
Catholicism no other form will satisfy the
Latins, and if criticism destroys Protestantism
with its infallible Bible, as it is destroying
Catholicism with its infallible Pope, these
sophisticated nations will scarcely replace one
object of worship by another. You have
said that a religion needs an uncritical people,
a people who do not think; so for any further
development we must turn toward a less
complete civilisation, to a virgin soil. Perhaps
we find this in Russia. I can imagine that
dreamy and unsophisticated people, who have
kept unpolluted through the ages the temperament
of wonder, reforming and developing
the Greek Church. When their Revolution
comes, whether it be gradual and humane,
or a violent upheaval of disastrous passion,
the Church will be metamorphosed; the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_282'>282</span>stock only will remain, and new boughs will
be grafted upon it. I can imagine a great
growth because the field has lain fallow
for so long, and the modern spirit will
scarcely touch it, not only because the new
Christianity will be more flexible in itself,
but also because the people will have inherited
our results without having endured
our conflicts."</p>

<p class='c000'>The clouds in front of them suddenly
trembled and parted; the figure of a man
appeared.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Mocenni!" exclaimed Leo.</p>

<p class='c000'>He rose and went toward the newcomer.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Who is Pope?" he enquired.</p>

<p class='c000'>And the Cardinal Mocenni answered him
in ill-humour.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Sarto."</p>

<p class='c000'>For a moment Leo stood, as if doubtful,
without speaking.</p>

<p class='c000'>"Sarto," he said at last incredulously.
"Sarto!"</p>

<p class='c000'>"Well, Monsieur," said Renan, "shall we
not continue our discussion on the future of
the Church?"</p>

<p class='c000'>But Leo had taken Mocenni's arm, and
the pair walked slowly away.</p>

<p class='c000'><span class='pageno' id='Page_283'>283</span>"Sarto! Sarto!" Renan heard Leo say
again, as the clouds gathered about them;
and Renan smiled.</p>

<p class='c000'>"It is clear," he said, "that Sarto is not
Leo."</p>
